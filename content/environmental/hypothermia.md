# Hypothermia

Hypothermia occurs when core body temperature drops below 95°F (35°C). It can occur in any environment, not just extreme cold - wet, windy conditions even at mild temperatures can cause hypothermia.

## Risk Factors

- Cold environment (especially wet + windy)
- Inadequate clothing/shelter
- Immersion in cold water
- Exhaustion/poor nutrition
- Alcohol/drug use
- Extremes of age (young and old)
- Medical conditions (diabetes, hypothyroidism, trauma)
- Prolonged immobility

## Stages of Hypothermia

### Mild (90-95°F / 32-35°C)
- **Shivering** (body trying to warm itself)
- "Umbles": Stumbles, mumbles, fumbles, grumbles
- Cold, pale skin
- Increased urination
- Poor coordination
- Apathy, impaired judgment
- Still conscious and responsive

### Moderate (82-90°F / 28-32°C)
- **Shivering stops** (bad sign - body giving up)
- Muscle rigidity
- Confusion, drowsiness
- Slurred speech
- Slow, weak pulse
- Slow breathing
- Paradoxical undressing
- Decreased level of consciousness

### Severe (<82°F / <28°C)
- Unresponsive or barely responsive
- Rigid muscles
- Very slow, weak pulse (may be hard to find)
- Very slow, shallow breathing
- Fixed, dilated pupils
- May appear dead
- Risk of cardiac arrest (V-fib)

:::warning
In severe hypothermia, a patient may appear dead but still be resuscitable. "No one is dead until they are warm and dead."
:::

## Assessment

### Measuring Temperature
- Core temperature requires rectal or esophageal probe
- Standard thermometers may not read low enough
- If no thermometer, estimate from clinical signs
- Don't rely on axillary (armpit) in hypothermia

### The "Umbles" Test (Mild Hypothermia)
- **Stumbles**: Can they walk straight?
- **Mumbles**: Is speech clear?
- **Fumbles**: Can they do fine motor tasks?
- **Grumbles**: Personality change, irritable?

### Shivering Assessment
- Shivering = body still fighting = better prognosis
- No shivering + cold = more severe = worse

## Treatment Protocol

### General Principles

:::warning
**Handle severe hypothermia patients GENTLY.** The cold heart is very irritable. Rough handling can cause fatal cardiac arrhythmias.
:::

:::checklist
- [ ] Remove from cold environment
- [ ] Remove wet clothing (cut if necessary)
- [ ] Insulate from ground
- [ ] Prevent further heat loss
- [ ] Begin rewarming appropriate to severity
- [ ] Handle gently (especially moderate/severe)
- [ ] Monitor cardiac rhythm if possible
- [ ] Prepare for evacuation
:::

### Mild Hypothermia Treatment

Patient is still shivering and conscious:

:::checklist
- [ ] Remove wet clothing
- [ ] Add dry insulation (sleeping bag, blankets)
- [ ] Give warm, sweet drinks (NO alcohol)
- [ ] Give high-calorie food if can eat safely
- [ ] Encourage movement/exercise if able
- [ ] Provide shelter from wind/wet
- [ ] Share body heat if needed
- [ ] Monitor for worsening
:::

**Key**: Mild hypothermia patients can rewarm themselves with help. Food and fluids provide fuel for shivering.

### Moderate Hypothermia Treatment

Patient is no longer shivering but still conscious:

:::checklist
- [ ] Handle gently
- [ ] Horizontal position (prevents blood pressure drop)
- [ ] Remove wet clothing (cut off)
- [ ] Insulate from ground, wrap completely
- [ ] Apply external heat sources to core
- [ ] Hot water bottles to armpits, groin, neck
- [ ] NO exercise (can drop core temp further)
- [ ] NO oral fluids unless clearly alert
- [ ] Prepare for evacuation
:::

**Key**: These patients cannot rewarm themselves. Provide external heat.

### Severe Hypothermia Treatment

Patient is unresponsive or near-unresponsive:

:::checklist
- [ ] Handle EXTREMELY gently
- [ ] Keep horizontal
- [ ] Assess for pulse/breathing (allow 60 seconds)
- [ ] If pulseless, start CPR
- [ ] Prevent further heat loss
- [ ] Passive rewarming only (insulation)
- [ ] NO active core rewarming in field
- [ ] Immediate evacuation
:::

:::warning
Severe hypothermia patients should ideally be rewarmed in a hospital with capability for invasive rewarming and cardiac support. Field rewarming is risky.
:::

### Cardiac Arrest in Hypothermia

- Check pulse for 60 seconds (may be very slow)
- If truly pulseless, begin CPR
- Continue CPR even if seems futile
- Limit shocks to 3 total until core temp >86°F
- "Not dead until warm and dead"
- Continue resuscitation during evacuation

## Heat Sources for Rewarming

**Passive rewarming:**
- Insulation (sleeping bags, blankets)
- Vapor barrier (plastic/foil to prevent evaporative loss)
- Shelter from elements

**Active external rewarming:**
- Hot water bottles (wrap in cloth, not directly on skin)
- Chemical heat packs (wrap, monitor for burns)
- Body-to-body contact
- Warm air (forced air warming blanket)

**Apply heat to core areas:**
- Armpits
- Groin
- Neck/sides of chest
- **NOT extremities** - can cause afterdrop

### Afterdrop

:::warning
**Afterdrop** is when core temperature continues to fall even after rewarming begins. Cold blood from extremities returns to core, cooling it further.
:::

**Prevention:**
- Rewarm core first, not extremities
- Keep extremities cool initially
- Avoid vigorous movement
- Monitor closely after starting rewarming

## Prevention

- Dress in layers (wicking, insulating, shell)
- Stay dry (change wet clothes promptly)
- Eat and hydrate adequately
- Recognize early signs ("umbles")
- Don't ignore shivering - it's a warning
- Carry emergency bivvy/shelter
- Travel with partners who can help

## Evacuation Criteria

:::evacuation[immediate]
- Severe hypothermia (unresponsive)
- Cardiac arrest
- Moderate hypothermia not responding to treatment
- Associated trauma
- Unable to rewarm in field
:::

:::evacuation[urgent]
- Moderate hypothermia
- Mild hypothermia with persistent symptoms
- Concerning underlying cause
- Unable to safely prevent recurrence
:::

:::evacuation[delayed]
- Mild hypothermia responding to treatment
- Patient returns to normal
- Cause identified and prevented
- Can continue safely with precautions
:::

## Key Points

1. **Shivering = hope** - Body still fighting
2. **No shivering + cold = severe** - Cannot self-rewarm
3. **Handle gently** - Cold heart is irritable
4. **Horizontal position** - Prevents BP drop
5. **Rewarm core first** - Avoid afterdrop
6. **"Warm and dead"** - Don't give up on cold patients
7. **Prevention** - Easiest treatment is not getting hypothermic
