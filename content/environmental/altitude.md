# Altitude Illness

Altitude illness occurs when the body fails to adequately acclimatize to decreased oxygen at elevation. It ranges from mild discomfort (AMS) to life-threatening conditions (HACE, HAPE).

## Altitude Zones

| Zone | Elevation | Risk |
|------|-----------|------|
| High | 5,000-11,500 ft (1,500-3,500 m) | AMS common |
| Very High | 11,500-18,000 ft (3,500-5,500 m) | AMS very common, HACE/HAPE risk |
| Extreme | >18,000 ft (>5,500 m) | All forms of altitude illness |

## Types of Altitude Illness

### AMS - Acute Mountain Sickness

**The "altitude hangover"** - most common form, usually mild

### HACE - High Altitude Cerebral Edema

**Brain swelling** - life-threatening, progression from AMS

### HAPE - High Altitude Pulmonary Edema

**Fluid in lungs** - life-threatening, can occur without AMS

## Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS)

### Recognition

**Lake Louise Criteria** - AMS requires:
1. Recent gain in altitude
2. Headache PLUS one or more of:
   - Nausea or vomiting
   - Fatigue or weakness
   - Dizziness or lightheadedness
   - Difficulty sleeping

**Symptoms typically:**
- Begin 6-12 hours after ascent
- Worse on second night at altitude
- Similar to hangover or mild flu

### Treatment

:::checklist
- [ ] STOP ascending
- [ ] Rest at current altitude
- [ ] Hydrate well
- [ ] Treat headache (ibuprofen, acetaminophen)
- [ ] Consider acetazolamide (Diamox) if available
- [ ] Do not ascend until symptoms resolve
- [ ] Descend if symptoms worsen or don't improve
:::

**Acetazolamide (Diamox) dosing:**
| Use | Dose |
|-----|------|
| Prevention | 125-250 mg twice daily |
| Treatment | 250 mg twice daily |

*Start 1 day before ascent for prevention, continue for 2 days at altitude*

### Key Rule

:::warning
**Never ascend with symptoms of AMS.** Mild AMS can progress to life-threatening HACE if you continue climbing.
:::

## High Altitude Cerebral Edema (HACE)

### Recognition

HACE = AMS + **Ataxia** (uncoordinated movement) or **Altered mental status**

**Signs and symptoms:**
- Severe headache (not responsive to meds)
- Ataxia (can't walk straight line)
- Confusion, disorientation
- Behavioral changes
- Drowsiness progressing to coma
- Nausea, vomiting
- May have retinal hemorrhages

**Heel-to-Toe Walk Test:**
- Ask patient to walk straight line, heel to toe
- Unable to do this = ataxia = possible HACE

:::warning
HACE is a medical emergency. Without descent, HACE can progress to coma and death within 24 hours.
:::

### Treatment

:::checklist
- [ ] DESCEND IMMEDIATELY (at least 1,000-3,000 ft / 300-1,000 m)
- [ ] Administer oxygen if available (2-4 L/min)
- [ ] Dexamethasone if available (8 mg initially, then 4 mg q6h)
- [ ] Portable hyperbaric chamber if descent impossible
- [ ] Keep patient warm
- [ ] Monitor airway
- [ ] Evacuate to definitive care
:::

**Dexamethasone** is life-saving in HACE:
- Reduces brain swelling
- Buys time for descent
- Is NOT a substitute for descent

## High Altitude Pulmonary Edema (HAPE)

### Recognition

HAPE = Fluid accumulating in the lungs at altitude

**Early signs:**
- Decreased exercise performance
- Dry cough
- Fatigue greater than expected
- Shortness of breath with exertion

**Progressive signs:**
- Shortness of breath at rest
- Productive cough (may be pink/frothy)
- Gurgling breath sounds
- Rapid heart rate
- Cyanosis (blue lips, fingernails)
- Orthopnea (worse lying down)
- Confusion/altered mental status (late sign)

:::warning
HAPE can progress rapidly. It is the most common cause of death from altitude illness. Early descent is critical.
:::

### Treatment

:::checklist
- [ ] DESCEND IMMEDIATELY (500-1,000 m minimum)
- [ ] Administer oxygen if available (4-6 L/min)
- [ ] Minimize exertion (carry patient if possible)
- [ ] Keep patient warm
- [ ] Nifedipine if available (30 mg extended-release)
- [ ] Portable hyperbaric chamber if descent impossible
- [ ] Position sitting up if descent delayed
- [ ] Evacuate to definitive care
:::

**Nifedipine** for HAPE:
- Reduces pulmonary artery pressure
- Dose: 30 mg extended-release every 12 hours
- May cause headache, dizziness

### HAPE vs HACE

| Feature | HAPE | HACE |
|---------|------|------|
| Primary organ | Lungs | Brain |
| Key symptom | Shortness of breath | Ataxia, confusion |
| Cough | Yes, may be pink/frothy | No |
| Can occur together | Yes | Yes |
| Treatment | Descent, O2, nifedipine | Descent, O2, dexamethasone |

## Portable Hyperbaric Chambers

**Gamow bag or similar:**
- Simulates descent (increases effective pressure)
- Buys time when descent is impossible
- NOT a substitute for descent
- Patient must be monitored inside
- Treatment: 1-2 hours, may repeat

## Prevention

### Ascent Guidelines

**"Climb high, sleep low"**

| Above | Sleep Elevation Increase | Rest Days |
|-------|-------------------------|-----------|
| 10,000 ft (3,000 m) | Max 1,000-1,500 ft/day | Every 3,000 ft gained |

### Pharmacologic Prevention

**Acetazolamide (Diamox):**
- Most effective prevention medication
- 125-250 mg twice daily
- Start 1 day before ascent
- Continue 2-3 days at altitude
- Causes increased urination, tingling in fingers/toes
- Makes carbonated drinks taste bad
- Sulfa allergy = relative contraindication

**Dexamethasone:**
- Alternative if can't take acetazolamide
- 2 mg every 6 hours or 4 mg every 12 hours
- More side effects than acetazolamide

### General Prevention

- Ascend gradually (allow acclimatization)
- Stay hydrated
- Avoid alcohol (first days at altitude)
- Avoid sleeping pills
- Eat high-carbohydrate diet
- Recognize early symptoms
- Don't ascend with symptoms

## The Golden Rules

:::warning
1. **If you feel unwell at altitude, it's altitude illness until proven otherwise**
2. **Never ascend with symptoms of AMS**
3. **If symptoms worsen or HACE/HAPE develops, DESCEND IMMEDIATELY**
4. **Descent is the definitive treatment**
:::

## Evacuation Criteria

:::evacuation[immediate]
- HACE (ataxia, altered mental status)
- HAPE (dyspnea at rest, cyanosis)
- Deteriorating despite descent
- Unable to descend
:::

:::evacuation[urgent]
- AMS not improving with rest
- AMS worsening despite stopping ascent
- Unable to manage symptoms
:::

:::evacuation[delayed]
- Mild AMS responding to rest and descent
- Recovered and acclimatized
- Can descend under own power if needed
:::

## Key Points

1. **Headache + altitude = AMS** until proven otherwise
2. **Stop, rest, hydrate** for mild AMS
3. **Ataxia = HACE** - descend immediately
4. **Shortness of breath at rest = HAPE** - descend immediately
5. **Descent is treatment** - medications buy time but don't replace descent
6. **Prevention works** - acetazolamide, gradual ascent
7. **"Climb high, sleep low"** - aids acclimatization
