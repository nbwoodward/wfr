# Lightning Injuries

Lightning strikes cause approximately 20 deaths and hundreds of injuries in the US each year. Unlike other trauma, lightning victims who appear "dead" may be successfully resuscitated with prompt CPR.

## Mechanisms of Injury

### Direct Strike
- Lightning hits person directly
- Most severe form
- Highest mortality

### Side Flash (Splash)
- Lightning hits nearby object
- Jumps to person
- Most common mechanism

### Ground Current (Step Voltage)
- Lightning hits ground nearby
- Current travels through ground
- Enters one foot, exits other

### Contact
- Person touching struck object
- Current flows through person

### Blunt Trauma
- Shock wave throws person
- Secondary trauma from fall/impact

## Effects on the Body

### Cardiac
- Immediate cardiac arrest (asystole)
- May restart spontaneously
- Respiratory arrest may persist longer
- Arrhythmias

### Neurological
- Temporary paralysis
- Confusion, amnesia
- Loss of consciousness
- Seizures
- Long-term cognitive effects

### Burns
- Often superficial (flashover effect)
- Linear burns in skin folds
- Feathering/Lichtenberg figures
- Entry/exit burns less common than electrical

### Other Injuries
- Ruptured eardrums (tympanic membranes)
- Cataracts (may develop later)
- Blunt trauma from being thrown
- Fractures, dislocations

## Recognition

### At the Scene
- Thunderstorm present or recent
- One or multiple victims
- May or may not see obvious burns
- May find victims unconscious

### Signs of Lightning Strike
- Cardiac or respiratory arrest
- Burns (linear, feathering pattern)
- Ruptured eardrums (bleeding from ears)
- Confusion, paralysis
- Torn clothing
- Nearby struck objects

### Lichtenberg Figures
- Fern-like or feathery skin pattern
- Pathognomonic (specific to lightning)
- Not true burns
- Fade within hours to days

## Treatment Protocol

:::warning
**Reverse triage applies to lightning.** Unlike other mass casualty events, prioritize patients who appear dead. Lightning cardiac arrest victims have high survival rate with immediate CPR.
:::

### Scene Safety First

:::checklist
- [ ] Is thunderstorm still active?
- [ ] If ongoing danger, move to safety FIRST
- [ ] Relocate victims if safe to do so
- [ ] Lightning can strike twice in same area
:::

### Reverse Triage Principle

**In lightning mass casualty:**
1. **First**: Treat patients who appear dead (no pulse/breathing)
2. **Then**: Treat patients who are conscious/responsive

**Why?** Those who are conscious will likely survive. Those in cardiac arrest have excellent chance of survival IF CPR started immediately.

### Initial Assessment and Treatment

:::checklist
- [ ] Ensure scene is safe
- [ ] Check responsiveness
- [ ] If unresponsive: Check airway, breathing, pulse
- [ ] If pulseless: BEGIN CPR IMMEDIATELY
- [ ] If pulse but not breathing: Begin rescue breathing
- [ ] Use AED if available
- [ ] Continue CPR until patient recovers or help arrives
- [ ] Once stable, assess for other injuries
- [ ] Stabilize c-spine if trauma suspected
:::

### CPR for Lightning Victims

- Lightning causes immediate cardiac arrest
- Heart may restart spontaneously
- But respiratory arrest often continues
- Rescue breathing critical
- CPR for lightning has better outcomes than typical cardiac arrest

:::warning
Do NOT assume lightning victims are dead. Continue resuscitation longer than for typical cardiac arrest. Recovery is possible even after prolonged arrest.
:::

### Secondary Assessment

After patient is stable:
- Full trauma assessment (may have been thrown)
- Check for burns
- Check ears for rupture
- Assess neurological status
- Check for fractures
- Document all findings

### Burns

- Usually superficial (current flows over body)
- Treat with standard burn care
- Cover with clean, dry dressings
- Watch for deeper burns at entry/exit points

### Paralysis

- **Keraunoparalysis**: Temporary paralysis (especially legs)
- Usually resolves within hours
- Limbs may be cold, blue, mottled
- Do NOT assume spinal injury based on paralysis alone
- May also have true spinal injury from fall/throw

## Prevention

### 30-30 Rule
- If time between flash and thunder is <30 seconds, seek shelter
- Wait 30 minutes after last thunder before resuming activity

### Safe Shelters
- Substantial building (not shed, pavilion)
- Hard-topped vehicle (not convertible)
- Stay away from windows

### If Caught in Open

**Reduce risk:**
- Descend from high ground
- Move away from tall isolated objects
- Spread out from group (5+ meters apart)
- Avoid bodies of water
- Put down metal objects (but don't waste time)
- Last resort: Lightning position (crouch, feet together, cover ears)

**Lightning position (last resort):**
- Crouch on balls of feet
- Feet together (reduces step voltage)
- Cover ears (protect hearing)
- NOT lying flat (increases ground current exposure)

### Warning Signs
- Hair standing on end
- Tingling sensation
- Metallic taste
- Buzzing sounds
- Strike may be imminent - crouch immediately

## Evacuation Criteria

:::evacuation[immediate]
- All lightning strike victims should be evacuated
- Even those who appear fine may have delayed complications
- Cardiac monitoring needed
- Potential for arrhythmias, neurological issues
- Ear evaluation needed
:::

## Long-Term Effects

Lightning survivors may experience:
- Chronic pain
- Cognitive difficulties
- Sleep disturbances
- Personality changes
- Cataracts (develop over months)
- Chronic headaches
- Depression, PTSD

## Key Points

1. **Reverse triage** - Treat "dead" patients first
2. **CPR saves lives** - Lightning cardiac arrest has high survival with CPR
3. **Scene safety** - Don't become another victim
4. **30-30 rule** - Prevention is best
5. **Burns are often minor** - The cardiac effects are the killer
6. **Paralysis may be temporary** - Keraunoparalysis is not spinal injury
7. **All victims need evaluation** - Delayed complications possible
