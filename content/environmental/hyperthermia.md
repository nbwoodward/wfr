# Heat Illness

Heat illness ranges from mild heat cramps to life-threatening heat stroke. In wilderness settings, exertion combined with environmental conditions can quickly lead to dangerous hyperthermia.

## Heat Illness Spectrum

### Heat Cramps (Mildest)
- Painful muscle spasms
- Usually legs, arms, or abdomen
- Associated with sweating and fluid loss
- Core temperature normal

### Heat Exhaustion (Moderate)
- Body struggling to cool itself
- Core temperature elevated but <104°F (<40°C)
- Patient is still sweating
- Mental status intact but may be fatigued

### Heat Stroke (Severe - Life-Threatening)
- Cooling system has failed
- Core temperature >104°F (>40°C)
- Altered mental status
- Medical emergency - can be fatal

## Risk Factors

- High ambient temperature
- High humidity (impairs sweating)
- Direct sun exposure
- Strenuous exercise
- Dehydration
- Inadequate acclimatization
- Alcohol/drug use
- Certain medications (anticholinergics, beta-blockers)
- Extremes of age
- Obesity
- Recent illness
- Previous heat illness

## Recognition

### Heat Cramps

- Painful muscle cramps/spasms
- Heavy sweating
- Normal mental status
- Normal or mildly elevated temperature

### Heat Exhaustion

**Signs and symptoms:**
- Heavy sweating
- Pale, cool, clammy skin
- Weakness, fatigue
- Headache
- Nausea, vomiting
- Dizziness, fainting
- Rapid, weak pulse
- Dark urine
- Core temp 100-104°F (38-40°C)
- **Mental status normal or mildly impaired**

### Heat Stroke

:::warning
Heat stroke is a life-threatening emergency. The key finding is **altered mental status** combined with **high temperature**. Cool immediately!
:::

**Classic heat stroke (non-exertional):**
- Hot, dry, red skin
- No sweating
- Usually elderly or chronically ill

**Exertional heat stroke (wilderness setting):**
- May still be sweating
- Occurs during physical exertion
- Younger, otherwise healthy individuals

**Signs and symptoms:**
- Core temperature >104°F (>40°C)
- **Altered mental status** (confusion, irritability, combativeness, seizures, coma)
- Hot skin (may or may not be dry)
- Rapid, strong pulse
- Rapid breathing
- Nausea, vomiting
- Seizures
- Loss of consciousness

### Heat Exhaustion vs Heat Stroke

| Feature | Heat Exhaustion | Heat Stroke |
|---------|----------------|-------------|
| Mental status | Normal or mild | **Altered** (confused, combative) |
| Temperature | 100-104°F | **>104°F** |
| Skin | Pale, cool, clammy | Hot, may be wet or dry |
| Sweating | Heavy | May or may not be present |
| Severity | Serious | **Life-threatening** |

## Treatment Protocol

### Heat Cramps

:::checklist
- [ ] Stop activity, rest in shade
- [ ] Stretch affected muscles gently
- [ ] Give fluids with electrolytes
- [ ] Avoid salt tablets (can cause vomiting)
- [ ] Rest until cramps resolve
- [ ] Resume activity gradually
:::

### Heat Exhaustion

:::checklist
- [ ] Move to shade/cool environment
- [ ] Remove excess clothing
- [ ] Lay flat, elevate legs
- [ ] Give cool fluids if conscious (small sips)
- [ ] Apply cool water to skin
- [ ] Fan patient
- [ ] Monitor for progression to heat stroke
- [ ] Rest for remainder of day
:::

**Fluid replacement:**
- Water with electrolytes preferred
- Sports drinks acceptable
- Avoid plain water only (can dilute sodium)
- Small, frequent sips (large volumes cause vomiting)

### Heat Stroke

:::warning
**Heat stroke = immediate aggressive cooling.** Every minute of elevated temperature causes organ damage. Cool first, transport second.
:::

:::checklist
- [ ] Call for evacuation immediately
- [ ] Move to shade
- [ ] Remove ALL clothing
- [ ] Begin aggressive cooling IMMEDIATELY
- [ ] Cold water immersion if possible
- [ ] Ice packs to neck, armpits, groin
- [ ] Wet entire body and fan vigorously
- [ ] Monitor temperature if possible
- [ ] Stop cooling when temp reaches 102°F (39°C)
- [ ] Manage airway if unconscious
- [ ] Be prepared for seizures
- [ ] Continue monitoring during transport
:::

### Cooling Methods (Most to Least Effective)

1. **Cold water immersion** - Most effective
   - Submerge in cold water (stream, lake)
   - Keep head above water
   - Target: Reduce temp by 0.2°F/min

2. **Ice water dousing**
   - Pour ice water over entire body
   - Continue until temp drops

3. **Evaporative cooling**
   - Wet entire body
   - Fan vigorously
   - Less effective in high humidity

4. **Ice packs to core**
   - Apply to neck, armpits, groin
   - Where large blood vessels are superficial
   - Less effective than above methods

:::warning
**Do NOT delay cooling** to transport patient. Cool first, then move. Even a few minutes of cooling before transport can save lives.
:::

## Field Rehydration

### Oral Rehydration
- For conscious, alert patients
- Small amounts frequently
- Sports drinks or oral rehydration solution
- Avoid very cold drinks (can cause cramping)

### Making Oral Rehydration Solution
If no commercial products available:
- 1 liter clean water
- 6 teaspoons sugar
- ½ teaspoon salt
- Mix thoroughly

### Signs of Dehydration
- Dark urine (should be light yellow)
- Decreased urine output
- Thirst
- Dry mouth
- Headache
- Fatigue
- Dizziness when standing

## Prevention

- Acclimatize gradually (7-14 days)
- Stay hydrated (drink before thirsty)
- Monitor urine color
- Take breaks in shade
- Wear light, loose clothing
- Avoid midday heat if possible
- Know your limits
- Watch partners for signs of heat illness
- Adjust pace for conditions

## Evacuation Criteria

:::evacuation[immediate]
- Heat stroke (altered mental status)
- Seizures
- Loss of consciousness
- Temperature >104°F (>40°C)
- Not responding to field treatment
- Unable to rehydrate orally
:::

:::evacuation[urgent]
- Heat exhaustion not improving with treatment
- Persistent vomiting
- Persistent elevated temperature
- Signs of severe dehydration
- Concerning underlying condition
:::

:::evacuation[delayed]
- Heat cramps resolved with treatment
- Heat exhaustion responding to rest and fluids
- Patient returns to normal
- Can prevent recurrence
:::

## Key Points

1. **Altered mental status + hot = heat stroke** = emergency
2. **Cool immediately** - Don't delay for transport
3. **Cold water immersion** is most effective cooling
4. **Heat exhaustion can become heat stroke** - Monitor closely
5. **Prevention is key** - Hydrate, acclimatize, recognize early signs
6. **Sweating doesn't rule out heat stroke** in exertional cases
7. **Stop cooling at 102°F** - Avoid overcooling
