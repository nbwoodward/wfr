# Bites & Stings

Venomous bites and stings are common wilderness emergencies. Management priorities include recognizing anaphylaxis, appropriate local wound care, and deciding on evacuation.

## General Principles

### Priority Assessment
1. **Anaphylaxis?** - Life-threatening allergic reaction (see Anaphylaxis protocol)
2. **Envenomation severity?** - How much venom, what species
3. **Local wound care**
4. **Evacuation decision**

:::warning
Any bite or sting can cause anaphylaxis in sensitized individuals. Always monitor for allergic reaction regardless of species.
:::

## Snake Bites

### North American Pit Vipers
**Rattlesnakes, Copperheads, Cottonmouths (Water Moccasins)**

**Identification:**
- Triangular head
- Vertical pupils
- Heat-sensing pits between eye and nostril
- Rattlesnakes: obvious rattle (may not always rattle first)

**Envenomation signs:**
- Fang marks (one or two punctures)
- Immediate pain and burning
- Progressive swelling (may extend up limb)
- Bruising, ecchymosis
- Nausea, vomiting
- Metallic taste
- Numbness/tingling around mouth
- Weakness
- Bleeding abnormalities

**Note:** 20-25% of bites are "dry bites" (no venom injected)

### Coral Snakes

**Identification:**
- "Red on yellow, kill a fellow; red on black, venom lack"
- Small, shy snakes
- Found in southern US

**Envenomation signs:**
- May be minimal local signs
- Delayed onset (hours)
- Neurological symptoms: weakness, paralysis
- Respiratory failure possible

### Snake Bite Treatment

:::checklist
- [ ] Move away from snake (don't try to capture/kill it)
- [ ] Keep victim calm and still
- [ ] Remove jewelry/constricting items
- [ ] Immobilize bitten limb at or below heart level
- [ ] Mark edge of swelling with time
- [ ] Evacuate to hospital with antivenom
- [ ] Monitor for anaphylaxis
:::

**DO NOT:**
- Cut the wound
- Suck out venom
- Apply ice
- Apply tourniquet
- Apply electrical shock
- Give alcohol

**Evacuation:** All pit viper bites should be evacuated for antivenom evaluation, even if initially minimal symptoms.

## Spider Bites

### Black Widow

**Identification:**
- Shiny black body
- Red hourglass on abdomen
- Web in dark, protected areas

**Envenomation signs:**
- Initial pinprick sensation
- Localized pain develops
- Muscle cramps (may be severe)
- Abdominal rigidity
- Sweating
- Nausea, vomiting
- Difficulty breathing

**Treatment:**
- Supportive care
- Pain management
- Clean wound
- Antivenom available for severe cases
- Evacuate for moderate-severe symptoms

### Brown Recluse

**Identification:**
- Tan/brown color
- Violin-shaped marking on back
- Six eyes (most spiders have eight)
- Found in southern/central US

**Envenomation signs:**
- Often not felt initially
- Develops into painful wound
- Characteristic "bulls-eye" lesion
- Central necrosis may develop (days later)
- Systemic symptoms uncommon but possible

**Treatment:**
- Clean wound
- Elevate limb
- Watch for wound progression
- No specific antivenom in US
- May need wound care follow-up

## Insect Stings

### Bees, Wasps, Hornets, Yellow Jackets

**Local reaction (normal):**
- Pain, redness, swelling at site
- Resolves within hours to days
- Treat with ice, antihistamines

**Large local reaction:**
- Swelling extends >10 cm from sting
- May last 5-7 days
- Increased risk of future systemic reaction
- Not same as anaphylaxis

**Systemic/anaphylactic reaction:**
- Symptoms away from sting site
- Hives, flushing
- Swelling of lips, tongue, throat
- Difficulty breathing
- See Anaphylaxis protocol

**Treatment:**
- Remove stinger (scrape, don't squeeze)
- Ice to reduce swelling
- Oral antihistamines
- Topical hydrocortisone
- Monitor for anaphylaxis

:::warning
**For known bee sting allergy with prescribed epinephrine:**
Use epinephrine at first sign of systemic reaction. Don't wait.
:::

### Fire Ants

- Multiple stings common
- Immediate burning pain
- Develop into pustules (sterile)
- Risk of anaphylaxis with multiple stings

**Treatment:**
- Move away from ants
- Brush off (don't slap)
- Ice, antihistamines
- Don't pop pustules (infection risk)

## Tick Bites

### Tick Removal

:::checklist
- [ ] Use fine-tipped tweezers
- [ ] Grasp tick as close to skin as possible
- [ ] Pull upward with steady, even pressure
- [ ] Don't twist or jerk
- [ ] Clean bite area with soap/water or antiseptic
- [ ] Save tick for identification if possible
:::

**DO NOT:**
- Apply nail polish, petroleum jelly, heat
- Wait for tick to "back out"
- Squeeze or crush tick body

### Tick-Borne Diseases

| Disease | Vector | Region | Symptoms |
|---------|--------|--------|----------|
| Lyme | Black-legged tick | Northeast, Upper Midwest | Bull's-eye rash, flu-like illness |
| Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever | Wood tick, Dog tick | Southeast, Atlantic | Fever, headache, spotted rash |
| Ehrlichiosis | Lone Star tick | Southeast, South Central | Fever, headache, muscle aches |

**Monitor for:** Fever, rash, flu-like illness in days to weeks after bite

### Prophylaxis
- Doxycycline prophylaxis may be considered in high-risk areas
- Single 200mg dose within 72 hours of tick attachment
- Discuss with medical provider

## Scorpion Stings

### Bark Scorpion (Arizona)
Only dangerous North American species

**Signs of severe envenomation:**
- Severe pain at site
- Numbness, tingling spreading
- Muscle twitching
- Roving eye movements
- Drooling, difficulty swallowing
- Respiratory distress

**Treatment:**
- Clean wound
- Ice for pain
- Evacuate for severe symptoms
- Antivenom available in Arizona

## Marine Envenomation

### Jellyfish

**Treatment:**
- Rinse with seawater (NOT fresh water)
- Remove tentacles with gloved hand/tweezers
- Vinegar may help (species dependent)
- Hot water immersion (113°F/45°C) for pain
- Monitor for anaphylaxis

### Stingray

**Treatment:**
- Control bleeding
- Hot water immersion (113°F/45°C) - denatures venom
- Remove visible spine fragments
- Wound care
- Evacuate for deep wounds

## Evacuation Criteria

:::evacuation[immediate]
- Anaphylaxis
- Pit viper bite (all need evaluation)
- Coral snake bite
- Severe systemic symptoms from any bite/sting
- Airway compromise
- Severe pain not controlled
:::

:::evacuation[urgent]
- Moderate local reaction with progression
- Black widow bite with significant symptoms
- Scorpion sting with neurological symptoms
- Spreading infection
:::

:::evacuation[delayed]
- Minor local reactions
- Tick bite (monitor for illness)
- Spider bite with minimal symptoms
- Stable, controlled symptoms
:::

## Key Points

1. **Anaphylaxis can occur with any sting** - Monitor all patients
2. **Don't cut, suck, or tourniquet** snake bites
3. **Pit viper bites need hospital evaluation** even if initially mild
4. **Remove bee stinger by scraping** (method less important than speed)
5. **Tick removal: pull steady, don't twist**
6. **Hot water helps** many marine envenomations
7. **Save the creature** if safely possible - helps with treatment decisions
