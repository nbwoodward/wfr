title: Secondary Assessment
---

The secondary assessment aims to narrow down the diagnosis of a patient. It includes:

1.  Taking baseline vitals
2.  Patient history - SAMPLE, OPQURST, 1ST STEP
3.  A physical exam

## Baseline Vitals

#### HR - Heart Rate

- Read for 15 seconds and multiply by 4.
- Normal HR is between 60 and 100 bpm
- Note pulse quality, is it strong, weak, slow, irregular, or thready?

#### RR - Respiratory Rate

- Pretend to take the HR reading again so the patient doesn't change breath pattern
- Read for 15 seconds and multiply by 4.
- Normal RR is between 12 and 24 bpm
- Listen for abnormal sounds, note coughing, wheezing, and labored breathing

#### BP - Blood Pressure:

- Feel for radial pulse in wrist or top of foot
- Is it strong, weak, or none

#### LOR - Level of Responsiveness - use APVU scale

- **A**lert and Oriented (A&O 1-4).
  - If they are alert ask who they are, where they are, what time it is, and what they were doing. Note:
    - Person, place, time, event (A&O x 4)
    - Person, place, time (A&O x 3)
    - Person, place, (A&O x 2)
    - Person (A&O x 1)
- **V**erbally Responsive - If they are not alert, do they respond to verbal stimuli?
- **P**ain responsive - If they are not verbally responsive, do they respond to a sternum rub or skin pinch?
- **U**nresponsive - The patient does not respond to any of the above.

#### SCTM Skin color, temperature, moisture

- **S**kin color - check skin color for irregularities:

  - Pink - look for normal colored skin at nail beds, and mucus membranes, palms, soles
  - Red or "flushed" - indicates vasodilation, can be caused by allergic reactions, fever, or hypothermia
  - Pale - Indicates vasoconstriction of blood vessels, can be caused by shock or hypothermia.
  - Blue - Indicates lack of oxygen, can be caused by asphyxiation

- **T**emperature - Check the skin for warmth, hot skin can indicate fever, allergic reaction, or heat stroke/exhaustion
- **M**oisture - Check for normal sweating
  - Dry skin can be a sign of dehydration
  - Profuse sweating at rest can indicate some types of shock

#### CSM - Circulation, Sensory, Motor

- **C**irculation - assess distal pulses and capilary refill (how quickly a thumb-press on the hands and feet refills with color)
- **S**ensory - Touch fingers and toes and ask if feeling is present
- **M**otor - Ask patient to wiggle fingers and toes, and push and pull against pressure

#### PERRL - Eye quality

Assess that the **P**upils are **E**qual, **R**ound, **R**eactive to light

## Patient History - SAMPLE, OPQRST, 1ST STEP

#### SAMPLE

Always ask about patient history

- **S**igns and symptoms
- **A**llergies
- **M**edications
- **P**re-existing conditions
- **L**ast in's and out's
- **E**vents prior

#### OPQRST

Ask when confused about a patient's pain

- **O**nset
- **P**rovoke
- **Q**uality
- **R**adiate
- **S**everity
- **T**ime/treatments

#### 1ST STEP

Ask when a you are confused about a patient's level of responsiveness (LOR)

- **S**ugar
- **T**emperature
- **S**alt
- **T**oxins
- **E**lectricity/elevation
- **P**ressure

## Head-to-toe Physical Exam

Use a head-to-toe exam to discover any underlying injuries

- Head: check for deformations, blood, pain
- Cervical spine: check for cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), pain
- Eyes: check for deformations and PERRL
- Mouth: check for blood, broken teeth
- Ears: check for blood, CSF
- Neck: check for inline trachea and distended jugular vein
- Chest: check by palpating clavicle, sternum, ribs, listen for abnormal breathing.
- Abdomen: check by palpating each quadrant for pain, tenderness, rigidity, and contusions
- Back: if patient can move palpate as much of spine as possible. Feel for deformity and listen for pain stimuli
- Pelvis: carefully and only once - check with inward compression of iliac crests to assess for stability
- Legs and Feet: palpate each leg, joint, and foot. Check CSM.
- Arms and Hands: palpate each leg, joint, and foot. Check CSM.

## Reassessment

#### Reevaluate:

- Chief complaint: has it changed? How?
- Primary assessment: is there anything new?
- Vitals: any changes?
- Interventions: are splints, bandages, medications still working?

#### Record:

- On athletic tape
- Write out SOAP notes
- Transfer to incident report form
