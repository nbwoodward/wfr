---

The secondary assessment aims to narrow down the diagnosis of a patient. It includes:

1.  Taking baseline vitals
2.  Patient history - SAMPLE, OPQURST, 1ST STEP
3.  A physical exam

## Baseline Vitals

- **HR** - Heart Rate

  - Read for 15 seconds and multiply by 4.
  - Normal HR is between 60 and 100 bpm
  - Note pulse quality, is it strong, weak, slow, irregular, or thready?

- **RR** - Respiratory Rate

  - Pretend to take the HR reading again so the patient doesn't change breath pattern
  - Read for 15 seconds and multiply by 4.
  - Normal RR is between 12 and 24 bpm
  - Listen for abnormal sounds, note coughing, wheezing, and labored breathing

- **BP** Blood Pressure

  - Feel for radial pulse in wrist or top of foot
  - Is it strong, weak, or none

- **LOR** - Level of Responsiveness
