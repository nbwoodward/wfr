# Spinal Injuries

Spinal cord injuries can result in permanent paralysis. However, unnecessary spinal immobilization carries its own risks and challenges. Modern wilderness medicine focuses on identifying who truly needs spinal precautions using clinical criteria.

## The Spinal Column

### Anatomy
- **Cervical** (C1-C7): Neck - most mobile, most vulnerable
- **Thoracic** (T1-T12): Mid-back - most stable
- **Lumbar** (L1-L5): Lower back
- **Sacral/Coccyx**: Pelvis

### What We're Protecting
- Spinal cord (nerve tissue)
- An unstable fracture could cause cord damage
- Partial injuries can become complete with movement
- Once cord is damaged, it doesn't regenerate

## When to Suspect Spinal Injury

### High-Risk Mechanisms
- Falls >3 feet (or greater than standing height)
- Axial loading (diving, falling onto head)
- High-speed impact (skiing, biking, climbing falls)
- Motor vehicle/ATV crashes
- Significant blow to head/neck
- Lightning strike

### Clinical Findings Suggesting Injury
- Midline neck or back pain
- Midline tenderness on palpation
- Neurological deficits (weakness, numbness, tingling)
- Altered mental status (cannot assess reliably)
- Distracting painful injury
- Signs of intoxication

## Spinal Assessment - Clearing the Spine

:::warning
The goal is to determine if the patient can be safely managed WITHOUT full spinal immobilization. This is called "clearing the spine."
:::

### The Patient CAN Be Cleared (No Immobilization Needed) If ALL of These:

:::checklist
- [ ] Normal level of alertness (GCS 15)
- [ ] No intoxication
- [ ] No midline neck/back tenderness
- [ ] No focal neurological deficit
- [ ] No distracting painful injury
- [ ] Patient can actively rotate neck 45° each direction (if cervical)
:::

### The Patient CANNOT Be Cleared (Needs Immobilization) If ANY of These:
- Decreased level of consciousness
- Signs of intoxication
- Midline spine tenderness
- Numbness, weakness, or tingling
- Significant mechanism + distracting injury
- Cannot participate in exam
- Cannot rotate neck due to pain

## Spinal Immobilization Techniques

### Manual In-Line Stabilization (MILS)

**First step for any suspected spine injury:**
1. Position yourself at patient's head
2. Place hands on either side of head
3. Bring head to neutral alignment (unless painful)
4. Hold head steady - prevent movement
5. Maintain until mechanically immobilized or cleared

### Cervical Collar Application

**If collar available:**

:::checklist
- [ ] Maintain manual stabilization throughout
- [ ] Size collar appropriately
- [ ] Slide back portion behind neck
- [ ] Bring front around chin
- [ ] Secure snugly but not tight
- [ ] Check that airway is accessible
- [ ] Continue manual stabilization after collar
:::

:::warning
A collar ALONE does not adequately immobilize the spine. It must be combined with other techniques and manual stabilization should continue.
:::

### Improvised Immobilization

**If no collar:**
- Roll clothing/padding around neck
- SAM splint shaped into collar
- Pack padding on either side of head
- Tape forehead to rigid surface

### Full Spinal Immobilization

**Components:**
1. Manual stabilization (continuous)
2. Cervical collar
3. Backboard or rigid surface (or vacuum mattress)
4. Head blocks or padding
5. Straps across body
6. Tape/straps across forehead

**Log Roll Technique (3+ rescuers):**
1. Leader at head controls and commands
2. Rescuers at shoulder, hip, and knees
3. Leader: "On my count, roll toward you"
4. Roll patient as unit onto side
5. Slide board behind patient
6. Leader: "On my count, roll back"
7. Center patient on board
8. Secure from head down

## Wilderness Spine Immobilization Considerations

### Challenges in Wilderness
- Backboards impractical for long carries
- Full immobilization prevents patient self-care
- Immobilized patients cannot self-rescue
- Time to definitive care is prolonged
- Backboard itself causes pressure injuries

### Alternative Approach in Wilderness

For patients who:
- Have concerning mechanism
- Have midline tenderness
- BUT have normal neuro exam and are alert

**Consider:**
- Cervical collar only
- Careful, assisted movement
- Self-stabilization during transport
- Avoiding high-risk movements
- Frequent reassessment

### When Full Immobilization is Essential

Full immobilization IS necessary:
- Unconscious patient
- Focal neurological deficits
- Altered mental status
- Unable to cooperate with careful movement
- Unstable spinal fracture known/suspected

## Neurological Assessment

### Motor Function
| Level | Test |
|-------|------|
| C5 | Shoulder shrug, biceps |
| C6 | Wrist extension |
| C7 | Elbow extension (triceps) |
| C8 | Finger flexion |
| T1 | Finger spread |
| L2 | Hip flexion |
| L3 | Knee extension |
| L4 | Ankle dorsiflexion |
| L5 | Great toe extension |
| S1 | Ankle plantarflexion |

### Sensory Function
- Test light touch in all extremities
- Compare right to left
- Note level where sensation changes

### Document Findings
- Motor function each extremity
- Sensation each extremity
- Time of assessment
- Any changes with movement

## Special Situations

### Helmet Removal
- Generally leave helmet in place
- Remove only if:
  - Airway needs management
  - Helmet prevents immobilization
  - Need to assess head injury
- Requires two rescuers
- One maintains manual stabilization while other removes

### Patient Found Prone (Face Down)
- Must roll to access airway
- Log roll maintaining spinal alignment
- Leader at head controls movement
- Roll toward rescuers

### Patient in Water
- Float patient supine
- Manual stabilization in water
- Slide board under while floating
- Remove from water on board

## Evacuation Criteria

:::evacuation[immediate]
- Neurological deficits (weakness, numbness)
- Decreased level of consciousness
- Difficulty breathing
- Progressive neurological changes
- Unstable patient
:::

:::evacuation[urgent]
- Midline tenderness with high-risk mechanism
- Patient requiring full immobilization
- Unable to clear cervical spine
- Significant pain with movement
:::

:::evacuation[delayed]
- Cleared cervical spine with low-risk mechanism
- Isolated back muscle strain
- Mild symptoms improving
- Patient ambulatory with minor discomfort
:::

## Key Points

1. **Not everyone needs a backboard** - Clinical clearance is appropriate
2. **Mechanism alone is not enough** - Need clinical findings too
3. **Alert + no midline tenderness + no neuro deficit + can range neck = clear**
4. **Manual stabilization first** - Before any device
5. **Neuro exam is critical** - Document, reassess, document again
6. **Collar alone is not enough** - It's just one component
7. **Wilderness differs from urban** - Prolonged immobilization has real risks
