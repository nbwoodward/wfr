# Fractures & Dislocations

Musculoskeletal injuries are common in wilderness settings. Proper assessment and splinting can prevent further injury, reduce pain, and enable safer evacuation.

## Types of Fractures

### Closed Fracture
- Skin intact over break
- May have significant soft tissue injury
- No direct communication to outside

### Open Fracture
- Bone exposed through skin wound
- High infection risk
- Urgent evacuation required
- May be small wound or obvious bone protrusion

### Stress Fracture
- Overuse injury
- Gradual onset pain
- No specific trauma
- May not be obvious on initial exam

## Types of Dislocations

### Joint Dislocation
- Bone ends no longer in contact
- Usually obvious deformity
- Very painful
- May compromise blood flow/nerves

### Subluxation
- Partial dislocation
- Bones partially separated
- May reduce spontaneously
- Still significant injury

## Assessment

### Primary Concerns

:::warning
Check circulation, sensation, and movement (CSM) BEFORE and AFTER any manipulation or splinting. Document findings.
:::

**CSM Check:**
| Component | How to Test |
|-----------|-------------|
| Circulation | Distal pulse, capillary refill, skin color/temp |
| Sensation | Light touch, two-point discrimination |
| Movement | Can patient move fingers/toes? |

### Signs of Fracture

- **Pain** at injury site
- **Swelling** (may develop over time)
- **Deformity** (angulation, shortening, rotation)
- **Crepitus** (grinding feeling - don't seek this)
- **Loss of function** (unable to use extremity)
- **Point tenderness** over bone
- **Bruising** (may be delayed)

### Signs of Dislocation

- **Deformity** at joint
- **Unable to move** joint through normal range
- **"Locked"** in abnormal position
- **Severe pain** with any movement attempt
- **Joint appears "out of place"**
- **Compare to opposite side**

## Splinting Principles

### Why Splint?
- Prevents further injury
- Reduces pain
- Protects blood vessels and nerves
- Enables safer transport
- Reduces bleeding into tissues

### General Principles

:::checklist
- [ ] Check CSM before splinting
- [ ] Remove jewelry distal to injury
- [ ] Expose the injury
- [ ] Cover any open wounds
- [ ] Pad bony prominences
- [ ] Immobilize joint above AND below fracture
- [ ] Immobilize bone above AND below dislocation
- [ ] Splint in position found (unless CSM compromised)
- [ ] Check CSM after splinting
- [ ] Elevate if possible
- [ ] Apply ice if available (protect skin)
:::

### Splinting Materials

**Rigid splints:**
- SAM splint (moldable aluminum)
- Board splints
- Trekking poles
- Tree branches

**Soft splints:**
- Pillows
- Sleeping pad
- Clothing
- Sling and swathe

**Improvised:**
- Buddy taping (finger/toe to adjacent)
- Body splinting (arm to chest, leg to leg)

## Specific Injuries

### Collarbone (Clavicle)
- Very common
- Usually from fall on shoulder
- Visible deformity often
- Sling and swathe treatment
- Generally heals well

### Shoulder Dislocation
- Almost always anterior (forward)
- Arm held away from body, rotated outward
- Visible "squared off" shoulder
- May need reduction in wilderness setting

### Upper Arm (Humerus)
- Significant force required
- High risk of radial nerve injury
- Test wrist extension
- Sling and swathe, or coaptation splint

### Elbow
- Don't try to straighten
- High risk of vessel/nerve injury
- Splint in position found
- Urgent evacuation if CSM affected

### Forearm (Radius/Ulna)
- Rigid splint, wrist to above elbow
- Include wrist and elbow joints
- Position of comfort

### Wrist
- Very common (Colles fracture)
- "Dinner fork" deformity
- Splint from fingers to elbow
- Sugar tong splint if available

### Finger Dislocation
- Often can reduce in field
- Pull traction, hyperextend slightly, flex
- Buddy tape after reduction
- Check that finger flexes/extends properly

### Hip
- Serious injury, significant force
- Shortened, rotated leg
- Cannot bear weight
- Do not attempt reduction
- Urgent evacuation

### Femur (Thigh Bone)
- Life-threatening injury
- Blood loss can be massive
- Shortened, rotated leg
- Traction splint if available
- Immediate evacuation

### Knee Dislocation
- Vascular emergency
- High risk of popliteal artery injury
- Check pulse IMMEDIATELY
- May need relocation if no pulse
- Urgent evacuation

### Patella (Kneecap)
- Displaced to side of knee
- Very painful
- May reduce with knee extension
- Splint with knee straight

### Lower Leg (Tib/Fib)
- Open fractures common
- Rigid splint, ankle to above knee
- Pad well, especially malleoli
- Elevate

### Ankle
- Very common
- Often cannot tell fracture vs sprain
- Splint includes foot and lower leg
- May need evac or may continue depending on severity

## Traction Splints

For isolated femur fractures:
- Reduces pain significantly
- Reduces blood loss
- Stabilizes for transport
- Requires specific device or improvisation
- Must maintain traction continuously

## When to Reduce/Realign

:::warning
Reduction attempts carry risk. Generally, realignment is indicated when CSM is compromised (no pulse, severe numbness, pale/cold extremity).
:::

**May attempt realignment if:**
- No distal pulse
- Extremity white/blue/cold
- Complete numbness
- Severe angulation preventing splinting
- Prolonged transport time
- Training/experience with procedure

**Do NOT attempt if:**
- Good CSM
- Near definitive care
- Uncertain about technique
- Obvious open fracture with bone visible

### Basic Realignment Technique
1. Control pain if possible
2. Apply steady longitudinal traction
3. Slowly bring to more anatomical position
4. Reassess CSM immediately
5. Splint in improved position

## Pain Management

- Splinting reduces pain significantly
- Ice (protect skin barrier)
- Elevation
- Over-the-counter: Ibuprofen, acetaminophen
- Prescription if available: Opioids, muscle relaxants
- Distraction, calm reassurance

## Evacuation Criteria

:::evacuation[immediate]
- Open fractures
- Compromised CSM (no pulse, white/numb)
- Femur fractures
- Hip fractures/dislocations
- Pelvic fractures
- Signs of compartment syndrome
:::

:::evacuation[urgent]
- All dislocations not reduced
- Fractures with significant deformity
- Fractures involving joints
- Fractures of both bones (e.g., both tib/fib)
- Patient cannot safely continue
:::

:::evacuation[delayed]
- Stable, splinted fractures with good CSM
- Minor fractures (toe, finger)
- Reduced dislocations with good function
- Patient can safely continue with assistance
:::

## Key Points

1. **CSM before and after** - Document circulation, sensation, movement
2. **Splint joints above and below** fracture
3. **Splint bones above and below** dislocation
4. **Open fracture = urgent evacuation** due to infection risk
5. **No pulse = consider realignment** despite risks
6. **Pad bony prominences** in splints
7. **Check CSM frequently** during transport
