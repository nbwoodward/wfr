# Bleeding Control

Uncontrolled bleeding is a leading cause of preventable death in trauma. In wilderness settings, the ability to rapidly control hemorrhage can be life-saving.

## Types of Bleeding

### Arterial Bleeding
- **Bright red** blood
- **Spurts** with each heartbeat
- **High pressure** - rapid blood loss
- **Life-threatening** - requires immediate control

### Venous Bleeding
- **Dark red** blood
- **Steady flow** (doesn't spurt)
- **Lower pressure** than arterial
- **Still serious** - can be significant

### Capillary Bleeding
- **Oozing** from wound surface
- **Slow** blood loss
- **Usually self-limiting**
- Often controlled with simple pressure

## Recognition of Life-Threatening Bleeding

:::warning
Life-threatening bleeding requires immediate action. An adult can bleed to death in 3-5 minutes from major arterial injury.
:::

**Signs of severe blood loss (Class III-IV shock):**
- Blood pooling or soaking through clothing
- Pale, cool, clammy skin
- Altered mental status
- Weak, rapid pulse
- Low blood pressure
- Rapid breathing

## Treatment Protocol - Stepwise Approach

### Step 1: Direct Pressure

:::checklist
- [ ] Expose the wound (remove/cut clothing)
- [ ] Apply firm, direct pressure
- [ ] Use gauze, cloth, or cleanest material available
- [ ] Press HARD - harder than you think
- [ ] Maintain pressure for minimum 10 minutes
- [ ] Do NOT lift to check - this disrupts clotting
:::

**Key points:**
- Use your palm and body weight
- Smaller wound = fingertip pressure on bleeding point
- One hand may not be enough - use both, or knee

### Step 2: Wound Packing (if direct pressure fails)

For deep wounds where direct pressure alone isn't working:

:::checklist
- [ ] Open wound with fingers if needed
- [ ] Pack gauze DEEP into wound
- [ ] Pack tightly - fill entire wound cavity
- [ ] Continue packing until wound is filled
- [ ] Apply direct pressure on top of packing
- [ ] Maintain pressure for 3+ minutes
:::

**Wound packing technique:**
1. Use plain gauze or hemostatic gauze if available
2. Push gauze deep into wound with finger
3. Pack tightly until wound cavity is full
4. Apply pressure bandage on top
5. Don't be afraid to pack firmly - it will hurt but may save life

### Step 3: Tourniquet (Extremity Bleeding)

:::warning
Tourniquets are for life-threatening limb bleeding that cannot be controlled with direct pressure. A properly applied tourniquet is painful - this is expected.
:::

**When to use a tourniquet:**
- Arterial bleeding not controlled with pressure
- Traumatic amputation
- Multiple casualties (apply TQ early to move to next patient)
- Unsafe scene (need to move quickly)
- Wound not accessible for packing

**Application:**

:::checklist
- [ ] Place tourniquet 2-3 inches above wound
- [ ] Place over single bone (upper arm or thigh)
- [ ] NOT over joint
- [ ] NOT over wound itself
- [ ] Tighten until bleeding STOPS
- [ ] Note time of application
- [ ] Do NOT remove once applied
:::

**Tightening:**
- Bleeding must STOP (not just slow)
- Distal pulse should disappear
- Yes, it is very painful - that's normal
- If bleeding continues, tighten more or add second TQ above first

### Step 4: Pressure Bandage

After bleeding controlled, apply pressure bandage:
- Elastic bandage wrapped firmly
- Should be tight but not restrict circulation to uninjured tissue
- Check distal pulse after application

## Hemostatic Agents

If available, hemostatic gauze (QuikClot, Celox) can help:
- Use same technique as plain gauze
- Pack directly into wound
- More effective than plain gauze
- Still requires direct pressure afterward

## Specific Situations

### Junctional Wounds (Groin, Axilla, Neck)
- Cannot apply tourniquet
- Wound packing is primary technique
- Pack deep, pack tight
- Prolonged direct pressure
- Consider junctional tourniquet devices if available

### Scalp Wounds
- Bleed heavily due to rich blood supply
- Usually look worse than they are
- Direct pressure usually sufficient
- Consider tight bandage around head
- Examine for underlying skull fracture

### Nosebleed (Epistaxis)
- Sit upright, lean slightly forward
- Pinch soft part of nose firmly
- Hold for 10-15 minutes continuously
- Do NOT tilt head back (swallows blood)

### Internal Bleeding
- Cannot directly control
- Recognize signs of shock
- Keep patient warm, lying down
- Rapid evacuation is only treatment

## Tourniquet Myths vs Facts

| Myth | Fact |
|------|------|
| Tourniquets always cause limb loss | Limbs survive 6+ hours with TQ |
| Only use as last resort | Use early for severe bleeding |
| Loosen periodically | Never loosen once applied |
| Apply over clothing is wrong | Over clothing is acceptable |
| Must be commercial device | Improvised can work if tight enough |

## Improvised Tourniquet

If no commercial tourniquet available:
1. Use wide material (2+ inches) - NOT wire, rope, cord
2. Wrap twice around limb
3. Tie half-knot
4. Place stick/pen on top of half-knot
5. Tie full knot over stick
6. Twist stick until bleeding stops
7. Secure stick in place

:::warning
Improvised tourniquets are less reliable. Use commercial devices when available. Any tourniquet must be TIGHT enough to stop arterial flow.
:::

## Evacuation Criteria

:::evacuation[immediate]
**All patients with significant hemorrhage require evacuation.**

Priorities:
- Life-threatening bleeding = immediate evacuation
- Tourniquet applied = immediate evacuation
- Signs of shock = immediate evacuation
- Deep wound packing = urgent evacuation
- Any wound that won't stop bleeding = urgent evacuation
:::

## Post-Bleeding Control

Once bleeding is controlled:
- Do NOT remove dressings (add more on top if needed)
- Keep patient warm (blood loss causes hypothermia)
- Position lying down with legs elevated (if no spinal injury)
- Give fluids if patient can drink safely
- Monitor for recurrent bleeding
- Document time of tourniquet application

## Key Points

1. **Act fast** - Severe bleeding can kill in minutes
2. **Pressure first** - Direct pressure is usually enough
3. **Pack it** - Deep wounds need wound packing
4. **Tourniquets save lives** - Don't hesitate on limbs
5. **Note the time** - Critical for tourniquet management
6. **Don't remove dressings** - Add more, don't replace
7. **Watch for shock** - Blood loss leads to shock
