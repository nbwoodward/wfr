# Wound Care

Proper wound care in wilderness settings can prevent infection and promote healing when definitive medical care is delayed. The principles are: clean it, close it (maybe), cover it, and watch it.

## Types of Wounds

### Abrasion
- Scraping injury (road rash, rock scrape)
- Superficial, damages top skin layers
- Painful but usually not serious
- High contamination risk
- Heals from edges inward

### Laceration
- Cut from sharp object
- Clean, straight edges
- May be superficial or deep
- May involve deeper structures
- Usually heals well if clean

### Avulsion
- Skin/tissue torn away
- Flap may be attached or completely detached
- Can involve significant tissue loss
- Often contaminated
- May need specialized closure

### Puncture
- Deep, narrow wound
- Nail, thorn, bite, stab
- May look minor but can be deep
- High infection risk (anaerobic)
- Difficult to clean

### Crush Injury
- Blunt force trauma
- Tissue damage under intact skin
- May have significant internal bleeding
- Watch for compartment syndrome
- May develop over time

## Wound Assessment

:::checklist
- [ ] Control any active bleeding first
- [ ] Assess wound depth and structures involved
- [ ] Check for foreign bodies
- [ ] Evaluate contamination level
- [ ] Test sensation and movement distal to wound
- [ ] Check circulation distal to wound
- [ ] Assess need for closure vs leaving open
:::

**Consider underlying structure damage:**
- Tendons (test movement)
- Nerves (test sensation)
- Blood vessels (check pulses, cap refill)
- Bones (visible? stable?)
- Joints (wound enters joint space?)

## Wound Cleaning

:::warning
The single most important factor in preventing wound infection is thorough cleaning and irrigation. "The solution to pollution is dilution."
:::

### Irrigation

**Supplies needed:**
- Clean water (potable drinking water is fine)
- Irrigation syringe or squeeze bottle
- At least 500mL water (more for contaminated wounds)

**Technique:**

:::checklist
- [ ] Wash your hands first
- [ ] Remove gross debris with tweezers/forceps
- [ ] Fill syringe with clean water
- [ ] Hold 1-2 inches from wound
- [ ] Use firm pressure to irrigate
- [ ] Irrigate all wound surfaces
- [ ] Continue until wound is clean
- [ ] Use at least 500mL per inch of wound length
:::

**Irrigation pressure:**
- Too gentle = won't remove bacteria
- Use syringe with 18-gauge needle/splash shield
- Or squeeze bottle held close to wound
- Should see water bouncing back from wound

### Debridement

Remove:
- Dirt and debris
- Dead tissue (gray/black, non-bleeding)
- Small foreign bodies

Leave:
- Any object you can't easily remove
- Objects near major vessels/nerves
- Large impaled objects (stabilize in place)

## Wound Closure Decisions

### Close if ALL of these:
- Clean wound after irrigation
- Less than 6-8 hours old (12-24 hours on face)
- Straight edges that come together
- No signs of infection
- Low-tension closure possible
- Not a bite wound
- Not heavily contaminated

### Leave OPEN if ANY of these:
- Contaminated and cannot adequately clean
- Older than 6-8 hours (except face)
- Signs of infection present
- Crush injury
- Human or animal bite
- Puncture wound
- Cannot bring edges together without tension

## Closure Methods

### Wound Closure Strips (Steri-Strips)
- Best for small, linear lacerations
- Clean, dry skin required
- Apply tincture of benzoin first if available

**Technique:**
1. Dry skin thoroughly
2. Apply benzoin to skin (not wound) if available
3. Apply strips perpendicular to wound
4. Space 3-4mm apart
5. Anchor on one side, approximate edges, anchor other side
6. Apply additional strips parallel to wound to reinforce

### Skin Staples
- Fast and effective
- Good for scalp lacerations
- Requires stapler and remover

### Sutures (if trained)
- Best tensile strength
- Requires training to use properly
- Various techniques for different wounds

## Wound Dressing

### Primary Dressing (touches wound)
- Non-adherent dressing preferred
- Petroleum gauze for wounds left open
- Keeps wound moist but not wet

### Secondary Dressing
- Absorbent layer for drainage
- Gauze pads or roll

### Outer Layer
- Tape or wrap to hold in place
- Not too tight
- Should be easy to check wound

### Dressing Changes
- Daily minimum, or if wet/soiled
- More frequent if heavily draining
- Document wound appearance each change

## Signs of Wound Infection

Watch for (usually after 24-48 hours):

:::warning
**Signs of infection - requires evacuation:**
- Increasing redness spreading from wound
- Increased swelling
- Increased pain (especially after improvement)
- Warmth around wound
- Pus or foul-smelling drainage
- Fever
- Red streaks from wound (lymphangitis)
:::

## Antibiotic Considerations

**Prophylactic antibiotics considered for:**
- Deep puncture wounds
- Animal bites (especially cat bites)
- Human bites
- Heavily contaminated wounds
- Open fractures
- Wounds involving joints
- Immunocompromised patients

## Special Wounds

### Scalp Wounds
- Bleed heavily - control with pressure
- Need irrigation despite bleeding
- Can often close with staples or sutures
- Examine for skull fracture beneath

### Hand/Finger Wounds
- High infection risk
- Test tendon function before and after repair
- Immobilize if flexor tendon involvement
- Low threshold for evacuation

### Foot Wounds
- High infection risk (especially punctures)
- Remove any foreign body if possible
- Cannot adequately irrigate deep punctures
- Consider prophylactic antibiotics
- Tetanus-prone

### Facial Wounds
- Can close up to 24 hours
- Cosmetic considerations
- Careful alignment of landmarks
- Evaluate for deeper structure damage

## Evacuation Criteria

:::evacuation[immediate]
- Active bleeding not controlled
- Open fracture
- Wound with neurovascular compromise
- Large tissue loss requiring surgery
- Joint involvement
:::

:::evacuation[urgent]
- Signs of infection
- Wound requiring suture closure (if not trained)
- Puncture wounds (especially feet, hands)
- Animal bites
- Deep wounds of hands/feet
- Foreign body that cannot be removed
:::

:::evacuation[delayed]
- Wounds healing normally but needing follow-up
- Sutures/staples needing removal
- Wounds closed that need inspection
:::

## Key Points

1. **Irrigate thoroughly** - Most important infection prevention
2. **Clean before closing** - Closing contaminated wound traps infection
3. **When in doubt, leave open** - Open wounds heal; infected closed wounds become problems
4. **Watch for infection** - 24-72 hours later is when it appears
5. **Tetanus consideration** - Know patient's vaccine status
6. **Document everything** - How, when, contamination level, treatment
