# Cardiac Emergencies

Cardiac emergencies in the wilderness present unique challenges due to delayed access to definitive care. Early recognition and appropriate management can be life-saving.

## Types of Cardiac Emergencies

### Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS)
- **Angina**: Chest pain from reduced blood flow (reversible)
- **Heart Attack (MI)**: Actual heart muscle death from blocked artery

### Cardiac Arrest
- Heart stops beating effectively
- No pulse, not breathing normally
- Requires immediate CPR

## Recognition

### Classic Heart Attack Signs

:::warning
Heart attacks don't always look like the movies. Many patients have atypical symptoms, especially women, diabetics, and elderly.
:::

**Classic presentation:**
- Chest pressure/squeezing ("elephant on chest")
- Radiating pain to left arm, jaw, neck, back
- Shortness of breath
- Sweating (diaphoresis)
- Nausea/vomiting
- Sense of impending doom

**Atypical presentations:**
- Indigestion or heartburn
- Fatigue/weakness
- Dizziness
- Upper back pain
- Jaw pain only
- No chest pain at all (especially diabetics)

### OPQRST for Chest Pain

| Component | Cardiac Findings |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Onset | Often with exertion or stress |
| Provocation | Worse with activity, not relieved by rest |
| Quality | Pressure, squeezing, heaviness |
| Radiation | Left arm, jaw, neck, back |
| Severity | Variable, often 5-8/10 |
| Time | >15-20 minutes (vs. angina <15 min) |

### Risk Factors

- Age >45 (men), >55 (women)
- Family history of heart disease
- Smoking
- High blood pressure
- High cholesterol
- Diabetes
- Obesity
- Sedentary lifestyle
- Recent extreme exertion/stress

## Treatment Protocol

### Conscious Patient with Chest Pain

:::checklist
- [ ] Stop all activity immediately
- [ ] Position of comfort (usually sitting up)
- [ ] Calm reassurance
- [ ] Give aspirin if available and no allergy
- [ ] Help with prescribed nitroglycerin if available
- [ ] Prepare for evacuation
- [ ] Monitor closely for deterioration
- [ ] Be prepared to start CPR
:::

### Aspirin Administration

**If patient is conscious and not allergic:**
- Dose: 160-325 mg (chew, don't swallow whole)
- Regular aspirin preferred (not enteric coated)
- Baby aspirin: 4 tablets (81 mg each = 324 mg)
- Give as soon as heart attack suspected

:::warning
Do NOT give aspirin if:
- Allergy to aspirin
- Active bleeding
- Recent stroke
- Taking blood thinners (relative contraindication)
:::

### Nitroglycerin (if patient has prescription)

**Assist patient with their own nitroglycerin:**
- Check blood pressure first (do not give if systolic <100)
- One tablet or spray under tongue
- Patient should sit or lie down (causes blood pressure drop)
- May repeat every 5 minutes x3 doses
- If no relief after 3 doses, likely MI not angina

### Cardiac Arrest - CPR

**If patient becomes unresponsive with no pulse:**

:::checklist
- [ ] Confirm unresponsiveness
- [ ] Check for normal breathing (agonal gasps are NOT normal)
- [ ] Check carotid pulse (10 seconds max)
- [ ] If no pulse, begin CPR immediately
- [ ] Send for help/evacuation
- [ ] Use AED if available
:::

**High-Quality CPR:**

| Component | Standard |
|-----------|----------|
| Hand position | Center of chest, lower half of sternum |
| Depth | At least 2 inches (5 cm) |
| Rate | 100-120 compressions/minute |
| Ratio | 30 compressions : 2 breaths |
| Allow full recoil | Yes, between compressions |
| Minimize interruptions | <10 seconds for any pause |

**CPR sequence:**
1. 30 chest compressions (hard and fast)
2. Open airway (head-tilt chin-lift)
3. 2 rescue breaths (1 second each)
4. Repeat until help arrives or patient recovers

:::warning
CPR is exhausting. Switch rescuers every 2 minutes if possible. Quality matters more than continuous effort by one person.
:::

### AED Use

If AED available:
1. Turn on AED, follow prompts
2. Attach pads to bare, dry chest
3. Clear patient, analyze rhythm
4. Deliver shock if advised
5. Resume CPR immediately after shock
6. Continue until help arrives

## Angina vs. Heart Attack

| Feature | Angina | Heart Attack |
|---------|--------|--------------|
| Duration | 2-15 minutes | >20 minutes |
| Relief | Rest, nitroglycerin | Not relieved |
| Cause | Temporary reduced flow | Blocked artery |
| Damage | No permanent damage | Heart muscle dies |
| Treatment | Rest, prevent progression | Emergency evacuation |

## Evacuation Criteria

:::evacuation[immediate]
**All suspected heart attacks require immediate evacuation.**

Priority: Get patient to advanced cardiac care as quickly as possible.

Transport considerations:
- Patient should not walk or exert themselves
- Carry patient if possible
- Helicopter evacuation ideal
- Continue monitoring throughout
- Be prepared for cardiac arrest during transport
:::

## Wilderness Considerations

### Prevention
- Pre-trip cardiac screening for high-risk individuals
- Know participants' cardiac history
- Gradual acclimatization to altitude and exertion
- Avoid extreme exertion, especially in heat/cold
- Carry aspirin in first aid kit

### When CPR Won't Help
In wilderness settings, consider stopping CPR if:
- 30+ minutes of CPR with no response
- Obviously fatal injuries
- Hypothermia (don't stop - rewarm first)
- Safe evacuation of rescuers is compromised

### Documentation for Handoff
- Time symptoms started
- Character of symptoms (OPQRST)
- Medications given (aspirin, nitro)
- Response to treatment
- Vital signs trend
- CPR details if performed

## Key Points

1. **Time is muscle** - Every minute of blocked flow kills heart tissue
2. **Aspirin early** - Chew 324mg at first suspicion
3. **Call for help** - Activate evacuation immediately
4. **Prepare for CPR** - 50% of heart attacks lead to cardiac arrest
5. **Atypical symptoms** - Women especially may not have classic signs
6. **Rest** - Absolutely no exertion by patient
