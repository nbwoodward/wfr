# Anaphylaxis

Anaphylaxis is a severe, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction that can occur within seconds or minutes of exposure to an allergen.

## Recognition

### Signs and Symptoms

**Skin:**
- Hives (urticaria)
- Flushing
- Itching
- Angioedema (swelling of lips, tongue, throat)

**Respiratory:**
- Wheezing
- Stridor (high-pitched breathing)
- Shortness of breath
- Throat tightness
- Hoarse voice

**Cardiovascular:**
- Hypotension (low blood pressure)
- Tachycardia (rapid heart rate)
- Dizziness
- Syncope (fainting)

**Gastrointestinal:**
- Nausea and vomiting
- Abdominal pain/cramping
- Diarrhea

:::warning
Anaphylaxis can progress rapidly to respiratory failure and cardiovascular collapse. Do not delay epinephrine administration.

## Treatment Protocol

:::checklist
- [ ] Remove or stop allergen exposure if still in contact
- [ ] Position patient supine with legs elevated (unless respiratory distress)
- [ ] Administer epinephrine IM into lateral thigh
- [ ] Monitor airway continuously
- [ ] Prepare for repeat dose if no improvement in 5-15 minutes
- [ ] Keep patient warm
- [ ] Provide reassurance

### Epinephrine Dosing

:::dosage
| Patient | Dose | Route | Location | Repeat |
|---------|------|-------|----------|--------|
| Adult | 0.3-0.5 mg | IM | Lateral thigh | q5-15 min |
| Child (>30 kg) | 0.3 mg | IM | Lateral thigh | q5-15 min |
| Child (<30 kg) | 0.15 mg | IM | Lateral thigh | q5-15 min |
| Infant | 0.01 mg/kg | IM | Lateral thigh | q5-15 min |
:::

### Additional Treatments (if available)

- **Antihistamines**: Diphenhydramine 25-50mg PO/IM (adults)
- **Corticosteroids**: May help prevent biphasic reaction
- **Oxygen**: High-flow if available
- **IV Fluids**: For hypotension if IV access available

## Common Triggers

- Food: Peanuts, tree nuts, shellfish, fish, milk, eggs
- Medications: Antibiotics (penicillin), NSAIDs, contrast dye
- Insect stings: Bees, wasps, hornets, fire ants
- Latex
- Exercise-induced (rare)

## Evacuation Criteria

:::evacuation[immediate]
**All patients with anaphylaxis require immediate evacuation.**

Reasons:
- Risk of biphasic reaction (6-12 hours after initial reaction)
- Need for extended monitoring
- Possible need for additional medications
- Airway may deteriorate

Transport considerations:
- Keep epinephrine available during transport
- Monitor airway continuously
- Position of comfort (usually semi-reclined if breathing difficulty)
- Keep patient warm
:::

## Key Points

1. **Time is critical** - administer epinephrine immediately upon recognition
2. **IM is preferred** - faster absorption than subcutaneous
3. **Lateral thigh** - best absorption site
4. **Don't wait** - mild symptoms can progress rapidly
5. **Repeat if needed** - second dose often necessary
