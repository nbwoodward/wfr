# Seizures

Seizures are episodes of abnormal electrical activity in the brain. They range from subtle staring spells to dramatic full-body convulsions. Proper management focuses on protecting the patient during the event and identifying the cause afterward.

## Types of Seizures

### Generalized (Tonic-Clonic / Grand Mal)
- Loss of consciousness
- Stiffening (tonic phase)
- Rhythmic jerking (clonic phase)
- May bite tongue, lose bladder/bowel control
- Lasts 1-3 minutes typically
- Confusion after (postictal state)

### Focal (Partial)
- May or may not lose consciousness
- Affects one body part initially
- May spread to generalized
- Unusual sensations, movements
- Patient may be aware during event

### Absence (Petit Mal)
- Brief staring spells (seconds)
- No convulsions
- More common in children
- May go unnoticed

## Common Causes

**Known epilepsy:**
- Missed medications
- Sleep deprivation
- Alcohol withdrawal
- Stress
- Flashing lights
- Illness/fever

**New onset (concerning):**
- Head injury
- Stroke
- Hypoglycemia
- Hyponatremia (low sodium)
- Hypoxia (low oxygen)
- Heat stroke
- High altitude cerebral edema (HACE)
- Drug/alcohol withdrawal
- Infection (meningitis)
- Eclampsia (pregnancy)

:::warning
New onset seizure in an adult without history of epilepsy should be considered serious until proven otherwise. This patient needs evacuation and evaluation.
:::

## Recognition

### During Seizure
- Sudden collapse
- Stiffening of body
- Rhythmic jerking movements
- Eyes rolling back or deviated
- Drooling, foaming at mouth
- May turn blue briefly
- Loss of bladder/bowel control
- Usually lasts 1-3 minutes

### After Seizure (Postictal State)
- Confusion, disorientation
- Sleepiness, exhaustion
- Headache
- Muscle soreness
- May not remember the event
- Gradual return to normal (minutes to hours)

## Treatment Protocol

### During Active Seizure

:::checklist
- [ ] Note time seizure started
- [ ] Protect from injury (move hazards, pad head)
- [ ] Do NOT restrain the patient
- [ ] Do NOT put anything in their mouth
- [ ] Position on side when possible (recovery)
- [ ] Protect airway from secretions
- [ ] Time the seizure duration
:::

:::warning
**Common myths to avoid:**
- Do NOT hold down or restrain
- Do NOT put anything in mouth (fingers, wallet, spoon)
- Do NOT try to stop the movements
- People do NOT swallow their tongues
:::

### After Seizure Stops

:::checklist
- [ ] Recovery position (on side)
- [ ] Ensure airway is clear
- [ ] Check breathing
- [ ] Check for injuries (tongue, head, limbs)
- [ ] Assess responsiveness
- [ ] Keep calm and quiet environment
- [ ] Monitor for recurrence
- [ ] Get history when patient can respond
:::

### Questions to Ask (When Patient Recovers)

**About the seizure:**
- "Has this happened before?"
- "Do you have epilepsy or a seizure disorder?"
- "What medications do you take?"
- "Did you take your medications today?"

**SAMPLE history:**
- Any recent head injury?
- Any illness or fever?
- Any drug/alcohol use?
- When did you last eat/drink?
- Any recent changes in medications?

## Status Epilepticus

:::warning
**Medical emergency**: Seizure lasting >5 minutes OR repeated seizures without regaining consciousness between them.

This is life-threatening and requires immediate evacuation and advanced medical care.
:::

**Management:**
- Protect patient
- Time the seizure carefully
- Prepare for evacuation
- If patient has prescribed rescue medication (rectal diazepam, midazolam), assist with administration
- Monitor airway carefully

## Evacuation Criteria

:::evacuation[immediate]
**Evacuate immediately if:**
- Status epilepticus (>5 min or repeated seizures)
- First-ever seizure
- Seizure following head trauma
- Seizure with fever/stiff neck (possible meningitis)
- Pregnant patient
- Prolonged postictal state (>30 minutes)
- Signs of stroke
- Possible HACE at altitude
:::

:::evacuation[urgent]
**Evacuate urgently if:**
- Seizure different from patient's usual pattern
- Multiple seizures in one day
- Unable to determine cause
- Significant injury during seizure
- Patient cannot continue trip safely
:::

:::evacuation[delayed]
**May continue trip (with caution) if:**
- Known epilepsy with typical seizure
- Clear cause identified and corrected
- Patient returns to baseline
- Has adequate medication supply
- Can be monitored closely
- Not in hazardous terrain
:::

## Wilderness Considerations

### Prevention for Known Epileptics
- Bring extra medications
- Maintain regular sleep schedule
- Stay hydrated
- Avoid known triggers
- Inform trip partners of condition
- Consider avoiding solo activities
- Carry medical ID

### Special Situations

**Seizure in water:**
- Support head above water
- Get to shore as quickly as safely possible
- Assume possible spinal injury
- Begin assessment once out of water

**Seizure at altitude:**
- Consider HACE if new onset
- Descend if uncertain
- Do not ascend further

**Seizure while climbing/exposed terrain:**
- Anchor patient if possible
- Protect from fall
- Evacuate from hazardous position when seizure ends

### Post-Seizure Activity

After a seizure, the patient should:
- Rest and recover (may need sleep)
- Not drive or operate equipment
- Not swim or be near water alone
- Not be on exposed terrain alone
- Be monitored for several hours

## Documentation

Record:
- Time seizure started and ended
- What patient was doing when it started
- Body parts involved
- Any preceding symptoms (aura)
- Duration of postictal confusion
- Injuries sustained
- Medications taken
- Patient's baseline seizure pattern (if known)

## Key Points

1. **Protect, don't restrain** - Move hazards away, don't hold down
2. **Time it** - >5 minutes = emergency
3. **Nothing in mouth** - No fingers, no objects
4. **Recovery position** - On side, protect airway
5. **New seizure = evacuate** - First-time seizures need evaluation
6. **Get history** - Known epilepsy vs new onset changes management
7. **Watch for recurrence** - Monitor closely for hours after
