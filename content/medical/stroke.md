# Stroke

A stroke occurs when blood flow to part of the brain is interrupted, causing brain cells to die. Every minute of stroke costs approximately 1.9 million neurons. Time is critical - "Time is Brain."

## Types of Stroke

### Ischemic Stroke (87%)
- Blood clot blocks artery to brain
- Most common type
- May be treatable with clot-busting drugs
- Time window for treatment: ideally <3-4.5 hours

### Hemorrhagic Stroke (13%)
- Bleeding into brain tissue
- Caused by ruptured blood vessel
- Higher immediate mortality
- Requires surgical management

### TIA (Transient Ischemic Attack)
- "Mini-stroke" - temporary blockage
- Symptoms resolve within minutes to hours
- WARNING SIGN of impending stroke
- Still requires urgent evacuation

## Recognition - BE FAST

:::warning
If ANY of these signs are present, assume stroke and evacuate immediately. Do not wait to see if symptoms improve.
:::

### BE FAST Assessment

| Letter | Sign | Test |
|--------|------|------|
| **B** | Balance | Sudden loss of balance or coordination |
| **E** | Eyes | Sudden vision changes, double vision, vision loss |
| **F** | Face | Ask to smile - does one side droop? |
| **A** | Arms | Ask to raise both arms - does one drift down? |
| **S** | Speech | Ask to repeat a phrase - is speech slurred or strange? |
| **T** | Time | Note time symptoms started, evacuate immediately |

### Face Test
"Smile for me" or "Show me your teeth"
- **Normal**: Both sides of face move equally
- **Abnormal**: One side droops, uneven smile

### Arm Test
"Close your eyes and hold both arms out straight"
- **Normal**: Both arms stay up
- **Abnormal**: One arm drifts downward

### Speech Test
"Repeat after me: The sky is blue"
- **Normal**: Clear, correct repetition
- **Abnormal**: Slurred, garbled, wrong words, unable to speak

## Additional Stroke Signs

- Sudden severe headache ("worst headache of my life")
- Sudden confusion or trouble understanding
- Sudden numbness (especially one-sided)
- Sudden trouble walking, dizziness
- Sudden vision problems in one or both eyes

### One-Sided Symptoms

Stroke typically affects one side of the body:
- Facial droop on one side
- Arm/leg weakness on one side
- Numbness on one side
- This is because one side of brain controls opposite side of body

## Treatment Protocol

### Immediate Actions

:::checklist
- [ ] Perform BE FAST assessment
- [ ] Note exact time symptoms started (critical!)
- [ ] Position patient comfortably (head elevated 30°)
- [ ] Do NOT give food, water, or medications by mouth
- [ ] Protect airway - patient may have trouble swallowing
- [ ] Keep patient calm
- [ ] Arrange immediate evacuation
- [ ] Monitor closely for deterioration
:::

:::warning
**Do NOT give aspirin** unless certain it's an ischemic stroke (you cannot determine this in the field). Aspirin could worsen a hemorrhagic stroke.
:::

### Positioning
- Elevate head 30 degrees if possible
- If vomiting or decreased consciousness, recovery position
- Protect weak side from injury

### Airway Management
- Stroke patients may have trouble swallowing
- Risk of aspiration is high
- Keep suction available if possible
- Nothing by mouth until swallow function verified

### What NOT to Do
- Do NOT give aspirin (unless directed by medical control)
- Do NOT give food or water
- Do NOT let patient "wait and see" if symptoms improve
- Do NOT elevate legs (increases blood to head)
- Do NOT delay evacuation for any reason

## TIA - Transient Ischemic Attack

**"Mini-stroke" that resolves:**
- Same symptoms as stroke
- Resolve within minutes to hours (usually <1 hour)
- No permanent damage
- WARNING: 10-15% will have full stroke within 90 days
- Many within 48 hours

:::warning
TIA is a medical emergency even though symptoms resolve. This patient is at very high risk for a full stroke and needs immediate evaluation. Treat and evacuate the same as a stroke.
:::

## Stroke Mimics

Consider other causes of stroke-like symptoms:
- Hypoglycemia (check blood sugar if possible)
- Seizure with postictal paralysis (Todd's paralysis)
- Severe migraine with aura
- Bell's palsy (facial droop only, no other symptoms)
- Intoxication
- Inner ear problems (vertigo)

**Key difference**: Stroke symptoms are typically sudden onset and one-sided

## Evacuation Criteria

:::evacuation[immediate]
**All suspected strokes require immediate evacuation.**

Time goals:
- Clot-busting drugs (tPA) work best within 3-4.5 hours
- Some interventions possible up to 24 hours
- Every minute matters

Transportation priorities:
1. Helicopter to stroke center (ideal)
2. Fastest ground transport to appropriate hospital
3. Call ahead so team is ready

Document clearly:
- **TIME SYMPTOMS STARTED** (most important!)
- Specific symptoms present
- Progression of symptoms
- Patient's baseline function
- Medications (especially blood thinners)
:::

## Wilderness Considerations

### Prevention
- Know risk factors (high blood pressure, diabetes, smoking, obesity)
- Take prescribed medications
- Stay hydrated
- Avoid extreme exertion in unacclimatized individuals
- Gradual altitude acclimatization

### Challenges in Remote Settings
- Long evacuation times may exceed treatment window
- Helicopter evacuation ideal when possible
- Start evacuation immediately - don't wait to see if symptoms improve
- Communicate "suspected stroke" to get appropriate destination

### Documentation for Handoff

Critical information:
1. **Time of symptom onset** (or time last known normal)
2. BE FAST findings
3. Symptom progression
4. Medical history (especially blood thinners, recent surgery)
5. Current medications
6. Any treatment given

## Key Points

1. **Time is brain** - Every minute kills neurons
2. **BE FAST** - Know and use this assessment
3. **Note the time** - When symptoms started (critical for treatment)
4. **One-sided** - Stroke typically affects one side
5. **TIA = Emergency** - Even if symptoms resolve
6. **No aspirin** - Can't tell stroke type in field
7. **Evacuate immediately** - Don't wait and watch
