# Asthma

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory airway disease causing reversible bronchospasm. Acute exacerbations can be life-threatening, especially in remote settings where definitive care is delayed.

## Recognition

### Signs and Symptoms

**Mild to Moderate:**
- Wheezing (expiratory > inspiratory)
- Shortness of breath
- Chest tightness
- Cough (may be only symptom)
- Increased respiratory rate
- Difficulty speaking in full sentences
- Anxious appearance

**Severe (Life-Threatening):**
- Silent chest (no wheezing - air movement too poor)
- Inability to speak
- Cyanosis (blue lips, fingernails)
- Altered mental status
- Extreme respiratory distress
- Accessory muscle use (neck, intercostal)
- Tripod positioning

:::warning
A "silent chest" in an asthmatic is a medical emergency. No wheezing may mean air movement is critically reduced.
:::

### Common Triggers in Wilderness

- Cold air
- Exercise (especially in cold)
- Smoke (campfire, wildfire)
- Dust and pollen
- Altitude changes
- Respiratory infections
- Stress/anxiety
- Allergen exposure

## Treatment Protocol

### Immediate Actions

:::checklist
- [ ] Keep patient calm and seated upright
- [ ] Remove from trigger environment if possible
- [ ] Assist with patient's rescue inhaler
- [ ] Monitor respiratory status
- [ ] Prepare for evacuation if severe
:::

### Inhaler Use (MDI - Metered Dose Inhaler)

**Albuterol (rescue inhaler) technique:**

1. Shake inhaler well
2. Patient exhales completely
3. Place inhaler in mouth, seal lips
4. Press inhaler while breathing in slowly
5. Hold breath for 10 seconds
6. Wait 1 minute between puffs

**Dosing:**
| Severity | Initial Dose | Repeat |
|----------|--------------|--------|
| Mild | 2-4 puffs | q20 min x3 if needed |
| Moderate | 4-6 puffs | q20 min x3 |
| Severe | 6-8 puffs | q20 min, evacuate |

:::warning
If using a spacer (recommended), it increases medication delivery. Follow same technique but spray into spacer, then inhale.
:::

### Additional Treatments

**If patient has prescribed medications:**
- **Oral steroids** (prednisone): Help reduce inflammation
- **Nebulizer**: If available and patient has medication

**Supportive care:**
- Calm reassurance
- Pursed lip breathing
- Warm, humidified air if available
- Hydration (thins secretions)

### Position

- **Seated upright** - optimizes breathing
- **Tripod position** - let patient assume naturally
- **Do NOT lay flat** - worsens breathing

## Severity Assessment

### Mild Attack
- Can speak in sentences
- Respiratory rate near normal
- Pulse ox >95% (if available)
- Wheezing present
- Responds to 2-4 puffs inhaler

### Moderate Attack
- Speaks in phrases only
- Respiratory rate elevated (>20)
- Pulse ox 91-95%
- Prominent wheezing
- Requires repeated inhaler doses

### Severe Attack
- Can only speak words
- Respiratory rate >30
- Pulse ox <91%
- Silent chest or minimal wheezing
- Poor response to inhaler
- Accessory muscle use
- Altered mental status

## Evacuation Criteria

:::evacuation[urgent]
**Evacuate immediately if:**
- Severe attack not responding to treatment
- Silent chest
- Altered mental status
- Cyanosis
- Unable to speak
- Exhaustion from breathing effort
- No improvement after 3 rounds of inhaler
- Patient's "worst attack ever"

**Evacuate urgently if:**
- Moderate attack requiring multiple treatments
- Incomplete resolution
- History of severe attacks or intubation
- Patient concern about worsening
:::

## Wilderness Considerations

### Prevention
- Bring adequate inhaler supply (+backup)
- Pre-treat before known triggers (cold air, exercise)
- Carry oral steroids if prescribed
- Know trigger avoidance strategies
- Consider trip timing (pollen seasons)

### Cold Air Strategies
- Breathe through a buff or balaclava
- Pre-treat with inhaler before cold exposure
- Warm up gradually before exertion
- Avoid deep breathing of very cold air

### High Altitude
- Asthma may improve OR worsen at altitude
- Cold, dry air is common trigger
- Have lower threshold for descent
- Ensure adequate acclimatization

## Differential Diagnosis

Consider other causes of wheezing/dyspnea:
- Anaphylaxis (look for hives, swelling)
- COPD exacerbation
- Pneumonia
- Pulmonary embolism
- Heart failure
- Foreign body aspiration
- Anxiety/hyperventilation

## Key Points

1. **Upright positioning** is critical
2. **Rescue inhaler** is first-line treatment
3. **Silent chest** = emergency
4. **Calm reassurance** helps reduce bronchospasm
5. **Know when to evacuate** - don't wait too long
6. **Prevention** is easier than treatment
