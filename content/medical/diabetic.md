# Diabetic Emergencies

Diabetic emergencies are common in wilderness settings due to changes in activity level, food intake, and stress. Recognizing the difference between low and high blood sugar is critical for proper treatment.

## Overview

### Types of Diabetes
- **Type 1**: Body doesn't produce insulin (requires insulin injections)
- **Type 2**: Body doesn't use insulin effectively (may use pills, insulin, or both)

### Blood Glucose Basics
| Level | Blood Sugar | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| Normal | 70-100 mg/dL fasting | Normal |
| Low | <70 mg/dL | Hypoglycemia |
| High | >180 mg/dL | Hyperglycemia |
| Very High | >250 mg/dL | Risk of DKA |

## Hypoglycemia (Low Blood Sugar)

:::warning
Hypoglycemia can become life-threatening within minutes. When in doubt, give sugar. Giving sugar to someone with high blood sugar won't harm them significantly, but withholding sugar from someone with low blood sugar can be fatal.
:::

### Causes in Wilderness
- Too much insulin for activity level
- Increased physical exertion
- Missed or delayed meals
- Vomiting/illness
- Alcohol consumption
- Cold exposure

### Recognition

**Mild Hypoglycemia:**
- Hunger
- Shakiness/trembling
- Sweating
- Anxiety
- Pale skin
- Fast heartbeat
- Irritability

**Moderate Hypoglycemia:**
- Confusion
- Difficulty concentrating
- Slurred speech
- Blurred vision
- Weakness
- Poor coordination
- Personality changes

**Severe Hypoglycemia:**
- Unresponsive
- Seizures
- Loss of consciousness
- Unable to swallow safely

### Treatment Protocol

:::checklist
- [ ] Recognize signs of low blood sugar
- [ ] If conscious and able to swallow, give oral glucose
- [ ] Wait 15 minutes and reassess
- [ ] Repeat glucose if still symptomatic
- [ ] Once improved, give complex carbohydrates
- [ ] Monitor for recurrence
:::

**Rule of 15:**
1. Give 15 grams of fast-acting sugar
2. Wait 15 minutes
3. Recheck (or reassess symptoms)
4. Repeat if still low

**15 grams of fast sugar =**
- 3-4 glucose tablets
- 4 oz (½ cup) fruit juice
- 4 oz regular soda (not diet)
- 1 tablespoon honey or sugar
- 6-8 hard candies
- Glucose gel packet

**After recovery (once blood sugar rises):**
- Give complex carbohydrates + protein
- Examples: peanut butter crackers, cheese and bread, granola bar
- This prevents repeat low

### Unconscious Patient

**If patient cannot swallow safely:**

:::warning
Never put anything in the mouth of an unconscious or seizing patient - aspiration risk.
:::

**Options:**
1. **Glucagon injection** (if available and trained)
   - Kit usually has syringe and powder to mix
   - Inject into thigh or upper arm
   - Patient should wake in 10-15 minutes
   - Will likely vomit - recovery position

2. **Glucose gel/honey** (if no glucagon)
   - Rub small amount on gums and inside of cheeks
   - Do NOT pour liquid in mouth
   - Less effective but may help

3. **Evacuate immediately**

## Hyperglycemia (High Blood Sugar)

### Causes in Wilderness
- Missed insulin doses
- Illness or infection
- Stress
- Reduced activity
- High carbohydrate intake
- Equipment failure (insulin pump, spoiled insulin)

### Recognition

**Early signs:**
- Excessive thirst
- Frequent urination
- Fatigue
- Blurred vision
- Headache

**Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) - Type 1:**
- All above symptoms plus:
- Fruity breath odor (acetone)
- Nausea/vomiting
- Abdominal pain
- Deep, rapid breathing (Kussmaul respirations)
- Confusion progressing to unconsciousness

**Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State (HHS) - Type 2:**
- Extreme dehydration
- Very high blood sugar (>600 mg/dL)
- Altered mental status
- Often triggered by illness

:::warning
DKA and HHS are medical emergencies requiring immediate evacuation. These patients need IV fluids and insulin management in a hospital.
:::

### Treatment Protocol

**Mild hyperglycemia (conscious, no DKA signs):**

:::checklist
- [ ] Help patient check blood sugar if meter available
- [ ] Assist with prescribed insulin if trained
- [ ] Encourage water intake
- [ ] Reduce carbohydrate intake
- [ ] Increase activity if safe
- [ ] Monitor for worsening
:::

**DKA/HHS (medical emergency):**

:::checklist
- [ ] Do NOT give insulin unless specifically trained
- [ ] Give water if patient can drink safely
- [ ] Evacuate immediately
- [ ] Monitor airway (vomiting common)
- [ ] Keep patient warm
- [ ] Document blood sugar, symptoms, timeline
:::

## Quick Differentiation

**"When in doubt, give sugar"** - Here's why:

| Feature | Hypoglycemia | Hyperglycemia/DKA |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|
| Onset | Minutes | Hours to days |
| Skin | Pale, sweaty, cool | Dry, flushed, warm |
| Breath | Normal | Fruity (DKA) |
| Breathing | Normal | Deep, rapid (DKA) |
| Thirst | Variable | Very thirsty |
| Immediate danger | **HIGHER** | Lower (slower) |
| Response to sugar | Rapid improvement | Minor/no worsening |

## Evacuation Criteria

:::evacuation[immediate]
**Evacuate immediately if:**
- Unconscious or cannot protect airway
- Seizures
- Signs of DKA (fruity breath, Kussmaul breathing, vomiting)
- Hypoglycemia not responding to treatment
- Unable to keep fluids down
- Altered mental status not improving
:::

:::evacuation[urgent]
**Evacuate urgently if:**
- Repeated hypoglycemic episodes
- Blood sugar equipment failure
- Insulin supply compromised
- Illness complicating diabetes management
- Patient unable to manage condition
:::

## Wilderness Considerations

### Prevention
- Carry extra glucose/snacks
- Bring backup blood sugar meter and strips
- Extra insulin in separate location (protected from temperature)
- Medical alert bracelet
- Trip partners should know about condition
- Adjust insulin for activity level (usually reduce)
- Regular snacks during extended activity

### Insulin Storage
- Keep cool but don't freeze
- Body heat can keep it warm enough in cold
- Insulated cases available
- Unused insulin: refrigerate when possible
- In-use insulin: room temperature OK for ~28 days

### Exercise Effects
- Exercise usually lowers blood sugar
- May need to reduce insulin before activity
- Snack before and during extended exertion
- Monitor more frequently
- Effects can last hours after activity

## Key Points

1. **"If in doubt, give sugar"** - Hypoglycemia kills faster
2. **Rule of 15** - 15g sugar, 15 min wait, reassess
3. **Fruity breath + rapid breathing** = DKA emergency
4. **Adjust for activity** - More exercise = less insulin or more food
5. **Carry supplies** - Glucose, meter, backup insulin
6. **Know your patient** - Type 1 vs Type 2 matters for treatment
