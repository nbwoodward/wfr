## Negligence

A civil negligence suit requires three conditions to be met: Duty to Act, Breach of Duty, and Injury Caused by Breach.

#### Duty to Act

In most states you are required to assist an injured person if you have a prior relationship with that person.
This includes if they are a participant in a program for which you are an employee or volunteer where providing medical care
is part or all of your duty.

The standard of care you are expcted to provide depends on the level of training you have received.

#### Breach of Duty

The law may find you at fault if you do not perform as a resonable person would with your background and training.

#### Injury Caused by the Breach

If a breach of duty is the direct or contributing factor to a loss or injury you can be found liable for negligence.
