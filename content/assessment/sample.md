# SAMPLE History

SAMPLE is a mnemonic used to gather essential medical history from a patient or bystanders. This information helps guide treatment decisions and is critical for handoff to EMS or hospital staff.

## When to Use

- After completing primary survey (ABCDE)
- During secondary assessment
- Any time you need patient background information
- Before making evacuation decisions

## The SAMPLE Mnemonic

### S - Signs and Symptoms

**Signs**: What you observe (objective)
- Vital signs
- Skin color, temperature, moisture
- Visible injuries
- Level of consciousness

**Symptoms**: What patient reports (subjective)
- Pain (use OPQRST for detailed pain assessment)
- Nausea, dizziness
- Shortness of breath
- Weakness, numbness

:::checklist
- [ ] What's bothering you the most right now?
- [ ] When did this start?
- [ ] How severe is it (1-10 scale)?
- [ ] Is it getting better, worse, or staying the same?
:::

### A - Allergies

Ask about allergies to:
- **Medications**: Penicillin, sulfa drugs, aspirin, NSAIDs
- **Foods**: Nuts, shellfish, eggs, dairy
- **Environmental**: Bee stings, latex, plants
- **Other**: Contrast dye, adhesives

:::warning
Document all allergies prominently. A patient with known anaphylaxis history to bee stings in the backcountry is a high-risk situation.
:::

**Key questions:**
- "Do you have any allergies?"
- "What happens when you're exposed?"
- "Do you carry an EpiPen?"

### M - Medications

Document ALL medications including:
- **Prescription medications**
- **Over-the-counter medications**
- **Vitamins and supplements**
- **Herbal remedies**
- **Recreational drugs/alcohol**

**Important medication categories:**
| Category | Examples | Significance |
|----------|----------|--------------|
| Blood thinners | Warfarin, aspirin, Eliquis | Increased bleeding risk |
| Diabetic meds | Insulin, metformin | Hypo/hyperglycemia risk |
| Heart meds | Beta blockers, nitro | May mask symptoms |
| Steroids | Prednisone | Immune suppression |
| Psychiatric | SSRIs, benzos | Altered mental status |

**Key questions:**
- "What medications do you take?"
- "Did you take them today?"
- "Do you have them with you?"

### P - Pertinent Past Medical History

Relevant medical conditions:
- **Cardiac**: Heart attack, CHF, arrhythmias
- **Respiratory**: Asthma, COPD, pneumonia
- **Neurological**: Seizures, stroke, head injury
- **Metabolic**: Diabetes, thyroid disorders
- **Surgical**: Recent surgeries, implants
- **Psychiatric**: Depression, anxiety, PTSD

**Key questions:**
- "Do you have any medical conditions?"
- "Have you ever been hospitalized?"
- "Any surgeries?"
- "Has this ever happened before?"

### L - Last Oral Intake

Document:
- **Last meal**: What and when
- **Last fluids**: What and when
- **Last urination**: When and appearance
- **Last bowel movement**: When and normal?

**Why it matters:**
- Dehydration assessment
- Diabetic emergencies
- Surgical considerations
- GI complaints

**Key questions:**
- "When did you last eat or drink?"
- "When did you last urinate?"
- "Are you staying hydrated?"

### E - Events Leading Up

The story of what happened:
- **Mechanism of injury** (trauma)
- **Onset of illness** (medical)
- **Activities before incident**
- **Environmental factors**
- **Witnesses account**

**Key questions:**
- "What were you doing when this started?"
- "Did anything unusual happen?"
- "How did you fall/get injured?"
- "Did anyone see what happened?"

## Documentation Tips

Write down or remember:
1. Patient name and age
2. Chief complaint
3. SAMPLE findings
4. Vital signs with times
5. Treatments given
6. Changes in condition

## Handoff Communication

When transferring care, use SAMPLE information:

> "This is [Name], [age] year old [male/female]. Chief complaint is [problem].
> Signs/symptoms include [findings].
> Allergies: [list or NKDA].
> Medications: [list].
> Past history: [relevant conditions].
> Last intake: [food/fluids/output].
> Events: [what happened]."

## Key Points

1. **Get the story** - Events (E) often reveals the diagnosis
2. **Medications matter** - Can explain symptoms or contraindicate treatments
3. **Allergies save lives** - Always ask before giving any medication
4. **Document everything** - Critical for continuity of care
5. **Keep asking** - Patients may remember more details over time
