# OPQRST Pain Assessment

OPQRST is a mnemonic for thoroughly evaluating a patient's pain or chief complaint. It helps characterize symptoms and can point toward specific diagnoses.

## When to Use

- Any patient with pain complaint
- Chest pain evaluation
- Abdominal pain assessment
- Headache evaluation
- Musculoskeletal injuries
- Any symptom that needs detailed characterization

## The OPQRST Mnemonic

### O - Onset

When and how did the pain/symptoms start?

**Key questions:**
- "When did this start?"
- "What were you doing when it started?"
- "Did it come on suddenly or gradually?"
- "Have you had this before?"

**Clinical significance:**
| Onset | May Suggest |
|-------|-------------|
| Sudden, severe | Cardiac, aneurysm, perforation |
| Gradual | Infection, inflammation |
| After activity | Musculoskeletal, cardiac |
| After eating | GI, gallbladder |
| Upon waking | Migraine, cardiac |

### P - Provocation/Palliation

What makes it worse? What makes it better?

**Provocation (worse with):**
- Movement
- Breathing
- Eating
- Position changes
- Palpation
- Exertion

**Palliation (better with):**
- Rest
- Position changes
- Medications
- Ice/heat
- Eating/not eating

**Key questions:**
- "What makes it worse?"
- "What makes it better?"
- "Does it hurt to breathe?"
- "Does moving make it worse?"
- "Have you tried anything for it?"

**Clinical significance:**
| Finding | May Suggest |
|---------|-------------|
| Worse with movement | Musculoskeletal |
| Worse with breathing | Pleurisy, rib fracture, PE |
| Better sitting forward | Pericarditis, pancreatitis |
| Better with antacids | GERD, ulcer |
| Worse with exertion | Cardiac |
| Unaffected by position | Visceral, cardiac |

### Q - Quality

How does the patient describe the pain?

**Common descriptors:**
- **Sharp/stabbing**: Often musculoskeletal, pleuritic
- **Dull/aching**: Often visceral, muscular
- **Burning**: Often GI, neuropathic
- **Pressure/squeezing**: Often cardiac
- **Tearing/ripping**: Often vascular (aortic dissection)
- **Cramping/colicky**: Often GI, renal
- **Throbbing**: Often vascular, migraine

**Key questions:**
- "Can you describe the pain?"
- "What does it feel like?"
- "Is it sharp or dull?"
- "Is it constant or does it come and go?"

:::warning
Classic cardiac chest pain is described as "pressure," "squeezing," or "elephant on my chest." However, many patients (especially women, diabetics, elderly) have atypical presentations.

### R - Radiation

Does the pain travel or spread anywhere?

**Key questions:**
- "Does the pain go anywhere else?"
- "Where did it start and where is it now?"
- "Do you feel it in your back/arm/jaw?"

**Clinical significance:**
| Radiation Pattern | May Suggest |
|-------------------|-------------|
| Chest → left arm, jaw, neck | Cardiac |
| Chest → back (between shoulder blades) | Aortic dissection |
| Abdomen → back | Pancreatitis, AAA |
| Abdomen → groin | Kidney stone |
| Abdomen → shoulder (Kehr's sign) | Splenic injury, ectopic pregnancy |
| Back → leg | Sciatica, disc herniation |

### S - Severity

How bad is the pain on a scale?

**Pain scales:**
- **Numeric (0-10)**: 0 = no pain, 10 = worst imaginable
- **Faces scale**: For children or language barriers
- **Functional**: "Can you walk? Sleep? Eat?"

**Key questions:**
- "On a scale of 0 to 10, how bad is the pain?"
- "Is this the worst pain of your life?"
- "How does it compare to [previous similar pain]?"
- "Does the pain prevent you from doing anything?"

**Clinical significance:**
| Severity | Concern Level |
|----------|---------------|
| 10/10, worst ever | High concern - evaluate for emergency |
| Sudden severe headache | "Thunderclap" - consider SAH |
| Severe tearing chest/back pain | Consider aortic dissection |
| Pain out of proportion to exam | Consider ischemia |

### T - Time

How has the pain changed over time?

**Key questions:**
- "How long have you had this?"
- "Is it constant or does it come and go?"
- "Is it getting better, worse, or staying the same?"
- "How often does it occur?"
- "How long does each episode last?"

**Clinical significance:**
| Time Pattern | May Suggest |
|--------------|-------------|
| Constant, worsening | Progressive pathology |
| Intermittent/colicky | Obstruction (bowel, ureter) |
| Comes and goes with activity | Angina, claudication |
| Worse at certain times | Ulcer (eating), GERD (lying down) |
| Hours to days | Inflammatory, infectious |
| Seconds to minutes | Musculoskeletal, neurologic |

## Putting It Together

### Chest Pain Example

> **O**: Started 30 minutes ago while hiking uphill
> **P**: Worse with exertion, slightly better with rest
> **Q**: Pressure, "like something sitting on my chest"
> **R**: Radiates to left arm and jaw
> **S**: 7/10
> **T**: Constant since onset, not improving

**Assessment**: Concerning for acute coronary syndrome - evacuate immediately.

### Abdominal Pain Example

> **O**: Gradual onset over 24 hours
> **P**: Worse with movement, better lying still
> **Q**: Sharp, constant
> **R**: Started around umbilicus, now right lower quadrant
> **S**: 8/10
> **T**: Getting progressively worse

**Assessment**: Classic presentation for appendicitis - evacuate urgently.

## Documentation Format

```
Pain Assessment:
O - [onset details]
P - [provocation/palliation]
Q - [quality description]
R - [radiation pattern]
S - [severity 0-10]
T - [timing/duration]
```

## Key Points

1. **Let patients use their own words** - Don't lead them
2. **"Worst headache of my life"** - Always take seriously
3. **Radiation patterns** - Can point to specific diagnoses
4. **Pain out of proportion** - May indicate serious pathology
5. **Changing pain** - Reassess frequently
6. **Document trends** - Is it improving or worsening?
