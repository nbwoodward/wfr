# ABCDE Primary Survey

The ABCDE approach is a systematic method for assessing and treating critically ill or injured patients. It ensures life-threatening problems are identified and addressed in order of priority.

## Overview

:::checklist
- [ ] Scene safety confirmed
- [ ] A - Airway assessed and managed
- [ ] B - Breathing assessed and supported
- [ ] C - Circulation assessed, bleeding controlled
- [ ] D - Disability (neurological) assessed
- [ ] E - Exposure complete, environment controlled
:::

## A - Airway

### Assessment
- Is the patient talking? (indicates patent airway)
- Look for obstruction: blood, vomit, teeth, foreign body, swelling
- Listen for abnormal sounds: stridor, gurgling, snoring

### Interventions
1. **Head-tilt chin-lift** (if no trauma suspected)
2. **Jaw thrust** (if trauma suspected - maintains C-spine)
3. **Suction** or finger sweep if visible obstruction
4. **Recovery position** if unconscious but breathing

:::warning
Always assume cervical spine injury in trauma patients. Use jaw thrust and maintain manual in-line stabilization.

## B - Breathing

### Assessment
- **Rate**: Count for 30 seconds, multiply by 2
  - Normal adult: 12-20 breaths/min
  - Tachypnea: >20/min
  - Bradypnea: <12/min
- **Work of breathing**: Use of accessory muscles, nasal flaring
- **Chest movement**: Equal and bilateral?
- **Auscultation**: If available, listen to lung sounds
- **SpO2**: If pulse oximeter available (normal >94%)

### Interventions
- Assist ventilations if inadequate
- Supplemental oxygen if available
- Seal open chest wounds (3-sided occlusive dressing)
- Needle decompression for tension pneumothorax (if trained)

## C - Circulation

### Assessment
- **Pulse**: Rate, rhythm, quality
  - Normal adult: 60-100 bpm
  - Check radial pulse first, then carotid if absent
- **Skin**: Color, temperature, moisture (cool/pale/clammy = shock)
- **Capillary refill**: Press nail bed, normal <2 seconds
- **Blood pressure**: If available
- **Bleeding**: Look for obvious hemorrhage

### Interventions
- **Control hemorrhage**: Direct pressure → Wound packing → Tourniquet
- **Position**: Supine with legs elevated (shock position)
- **Warmth**: Prevent hypothermia
- **IV/IO access**: If available and trained

:::dosage
| Finding | Indication |
|---------|------------|
| Radial pulse present | SBP likely >80 mmHg |
| Radial pulse absent, carotid present | SBP likely 60-80 mmHg |
| Carotid pulse absent | SBP likely <60 mmHg |
:::

## D - Disability

### Assessment
- **AVPU Scale**:
  - **A**lert - Patient is awake and oriented
  - **V**erbal - Responds to verbal stimuli
  - **P**ain - Responds only to painful stimuli
  - **U**nresponsive - No response

- **Pupils**: Size, equality, reactivity to light
- **Blood glucose**: If glucometer available
- **Gross motor function**: Can patient move all extremities?

### Interventions
- Protect C-spine if trauma
- Treat hypoglycemia if identified
- Position unconscious patient in recovery position (if no trauma)

## E - Exposure/Environment

### Assessment
- **Completely expose** patient to find hidden injuries
- **Log roll** to check posterior surfaces
- **Temperature**: Check for hypothermia/hyperthermia

### Interventions
- Remove wet clothing
- Prevent heat loss (blankets, insulation from ground)
- Protect patient dignity
- Document all findings

:::warning
Hypothermia is a major killer in wilderness emergencies. Always prevent heat loss, even in warm weather.

## Reassessment

After completing the primary survey:
1. Reassess ABCDE frequently (every 5 minutes for critical patients)
2. Perform secondary survey (head-to-toe exam) when patient is stable
3. Obtain SAMPLE history

## Key Points

1. **Life threats first** - Always follow ABCDE order
2. **Treat as you go** - Address problems before moving to next step
3. **Reassess often** - Patients can deteriorate quickly
4. **Document findings** - Important for handoff and evacuation decisions
