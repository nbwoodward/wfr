# Evacuation Decision Making

One of the most important decisions in wilderness medicine is whether, when, and how to evacuate a patient. This framework helps guide that decision.

## The Core Questions

Every evacuation decision involves answering:

1. **Does this patient need evacuation?**
2. **How urgently?**
3. **By what means?**
4. **To where?**

## Evacuation Categories

### Immediate (Emergent)
**Life-threatening condition requiring fastest possible transport**

:::warning
Time-critical emergencies where delays directly increase mortality or morbidity
:::

**Examples:**
- Cardiac arrest/heart attack
- Stroke (time = brain)
- Severe anaphylaxis
- Airway compromise
- Uncontrolled hemorrhage
- Severe head injury
- Spinal cord injury with deficit
- HACE/HAPE
- Heat stroke
- Severe hypothermia
- Open chest wound
- Major burns

**Transport:** Helicopter if available, fastest ground transport

### Urgent
**Serious condition requiring evacuation within hours**

**Examples:**
- Moderate head injury
- Open fractures
- Dislocations not reduced
- Femur fractures
- Moderate hypothermia
- Diabetic emergency
- Severe dehydration
- Significant infections
- Abdominal emergencies
- Active labor
- Medication emergencies

**Transport:** Ground or helicopter depending on terrain/distance

### Delayed (Expedient)
**Condition requiring evaluation but not time-critical**

**Examples:**
- Stable closed fractures
- Resolved mild hypothermia
- Controlled wound
- Minor head injury - improving
- Resolved hypoglycemia
- Stable medical conditions needing follow-up

**Transport:** Ground, patient may be able to assist

### Field Treatable
**Can be managed in the field without evacuation**

**Examples:**
- Minor wounds (cleaned, closed)
- Minor sprains/strains
- Mild altitude illness (responding to rest)
- Minor bites/stings (no systemic reaction)
- Simple blisters
- Minor burns
- Self-limited illnesses

## Decision Framework

### Step 1: Assess the Patient

:::checklist
- [ ] Complete primary survey (ABCDE)
- [ ] Obtain vital signs
- [ ] Complete secondary survey
- [ ] Identify all injuries/illnesses
- [ ] Document current condition
- [ ] Note trends (improving, worsening, stable)
:::

### Step 2: Consider the Condition

**Questions to ask:**
- Is this condition life-threatening?
- Will it become life-threatening?
- Does definitive care require resources not available in the field?
- Is time a critical factor in outcome?
- Can this condition be safely managed in the field?
- What is the risk of deterioration?

### Step 3: Consider the Resources

**What do you have available?**
- Medical supplies
- Medications
- Shelter
- Food and water
- Communication
- Navigation
- Rescue resources

### Step 4: Consider the Environment

**What are the conditions?**
- Weather (current and forecast)
- Terrain
- Distance to trailhead/road
- Time of day
- Group size and capabilities
- Helicopter landing zones
- Cell/radio coverage

### Step 5: Make the Decision

| If... | Then... |
|-------|---------|
| Life-threatening emergency | Immediate evacuation |
| Serious but not immediately life-threatening | Urgent evacuation |
| Needs medical care but stable | Plan evacuation |
| Treatable in field | Treat, monitor, reassess |
| Uncertain | Err on side of evacuation |

## Evacuation Methods

### Self-Evacuation (Walk Out)
**Patient ambulatory with assistance**

**Appropriate when:**
- Patient can walk with minimal assistance
- Condition stable
- Distance manageable
- Terrain allows
- Weather permits
- Not time-critical

**Precautions:**
- Frequent rest stops
- Monitor for deterioration
- Have backup plan if condition worsens
- Someone should walk with patient

### Assisted Evacuation (Carry Out)
**Patient cannot walk, group carries**

**Options:**
- Improvised litter
- Commercial litter
- Two-person carry techniques
- Rope-assisted lowering

**Considerations:**
- Extremely resource-intensive
- Slow progress
- Risk of rescuer injury
- May need to send for help instead

### Ground Rescue (SAR, EMS)
**Professional rescue team responds**

**Request when:**
- Cannot safely self-evacuate
- Technical terrain
- Patient needs litter evacuation
- Need additional medical resources
- Group too small to carry safely

### Helicopter Evacuation
**Fastest but not always available/appropriate**

**Request when:**
- Immediate/urgent evacuation needed
- Ground transport too slow
- Terrain prevents ground access
- Resources available

**Requirements:**
- Landing zone (100ft x 100ft clear)
- GPS coordinates
- Patient weight
- Nature of injuries
- Number of patients
- Weather must permit

**Limitations:**
- Not available everywhere
- Weather dependent
- Limited weight capacity
- May need stabilization to move to LZ

## Communication for Rescue

### What to Communicate

:::checklist
- [ ] Location (GPS coordinates, description)
- [ ] Number of patients
- [ ] Nature of emergency
- [ ] Patient condition (stable, unstable)
- [ ] Resources needed
- [ ] Hazards at scene
- [ ] Landing zone status (helicopter)
- [ ] Contact information
- [ ] Your plan while waiting
:::

### Example Rescue Request

> "We have a 45-year-old male with a suspected heart attack at GPS coordinates [X]. Patient is conscious but having chest pain. We've given aspirin and he's resting. We cannot walk him out - terrain is steep and he's too weak. Request helicopter evacuation. We have a clear landing zone approximately 200 meters from patient at [GPS]. Weather is clear. Party of 4 adults will remain with patient. Cell phone contact [number]."

## When to Wait vs. Go

### Arguments for Evacuating Now
- Time-sensitive condition
- Condition worsening
- Resources depleting
- Weather window closing
- Patient wants evacuation
- Cannot manage condition in field

### Arguments for Stabilizing First
- Severe weather approaching
- Night travel dangerous
- Need to prepare patient (splinting, packaging)
- Help is already coming
- Moving would worsen condition
- Short-term stabilization possible

### Arguments for Staying in Place
- Rescue is en route
- Weather too dangerous
- Technical terrain at night
- Patient condition allows
- Moving would delay rescue

## Documentation

**Record and report:**
- Time of incident
- Mechanism of injury/nature of illness
- Initial findings (SAMPLE, vitals)
- All treatments given
- Response to treatment
- Vital sign trends
- Time and content of communications
- Any changes in condition

## Special Considerations

### Multiple Patients
- Triage to identify priorities
- Most critical may not go first (if resources limited)
- May need multiple evacuations
- Document all patients

### Group Safety
- Don't endanger rescuers
- May need to split party
- Consider group resources if sending people for help
- Never send someone alone if avoidable

### Legal/Consent Issues
- Patient can refuse evacuation
- Document refusal
- Ensure patient understands risks
- Consider mental status in refusal

## Key Points

1. **When in doubt, evacuate** - It's rarely wrong to seek medical care
2. **Time matters for some conditions** - Know which ones
3. **Communicate clearly** - Rescuers need accurate information
4. **Document everything** - Important for handoff and continuity
5. **Don't become another patient** - Rescuer safety matters
6. **Have a backup plan** - Weather, helicopter availability can change
7. **Know your resources** - Understand what's available in your area
